excerpt: A D&D story that takes place in the celestial city of Sen.
---

Amidst the streets of the celestial city of Sen, a metropolis brimming with diverse cultures and innovation, the stage is set for a tale of political intrigue and high-stakes maneuvering. A thrilling tale revolving around the illustrious **Viola Santini**, the matriarch of a grand aristocratic household. In this story, you will find yourself embroiled in a world where political influence is wielded as deftly as a sword, and every word spoken can carry the weight of a dynasty.

As you navigate the intricate web that defines Sen's aristocracy, you will encounter a cast of characters as colorful and diverse as the city itself; cunning nobles, shrewd merchants, ambitious upstarts, all vying to carve out their own little kingdoms in the city. And behind the facade of wealth and privilege, secrets lie hidden, waiting to be uncovered by those with the tenacity to seek them out.

Throughout the city and the world of Sen's political elite, there are whispers of a darker undercurrent, of shadows lurking in the darkest corners of the city's estates and boulevards. It is here, in the heart of Sen's power structure, that you will uncover the truth behind a sinister plot that threatens to plunge the city into chaos. With every step you draw closer to unraveling the mystery, all while facing the looming specter of an enigmatic force spreading 
terror across the city.

Through fated circumstance, you find yourself attending a grand gala at the Santini estate, whether through formal invitation, employment arrangements, more clandestine intentions, or something else altogether. Viola Santini has gathered the area's political elite to address the growing threat of the figure known as **The Violet Lady**.

> I plan on running the story over a few months- no set date on when it will start, this is just to get you excited and to start thinking about a character that might fit the setting for a story surrounding a powerful aristocratic family. **Note:** While Sen and the Violet Lady have appeared previously in the Oster campaign, I can assure those who did not take part that that story has no bearing on this one; during the course of that campaign Sen was primarily shrouded in mystery, and the Violet Lady was portrayed very differently to how she is in this story. As of writing this, I have no intention of linking the two stories; I’m merely re-using concepts and ideas I’ve already established in my own writing. If anyone has any concerns about any content relating to the previous campaign I ran, reach out to me and we can discuss.
