# Sen Judiciary Council Election Remains Unsettled

**SEN**— Months after Magistrate Halford’s assassination, Sen remains without a successor, as the election process to fill his seat drags on amid political maneuvering and public uncertainty.

Three candidates have emerged as frontrunners:

* **Eldric Silversaint**, a seasoned political advisor and law-and-order advocate, has strong ties to the late magistrate’s administration. Critics argue his close connections may hinder needed reform.
* **Seraphine Arkwright**, a rising merchant and economic reformist, emphasizes trade growth and support for local businesses, though opponents warn this focus could overlook social issues.
* **Geronimo Vale**, a younger progressive with a scholarly background, champions transparency and social justice reforms, but some question whether his idealism can meet Sen’s practical needs.

Disagreements over voting procedures and eligibility have slowed the process, leaving the city in a prolonged power vacuum. Citizens and council members alike are watching closely, anxious for a resolution that can restore confidence in the judiciary and maintain stability across the city.

The race remains tight, with no clear winner in sight, leaving Sen poised on a knife’s edge between tradition, commerce, and progressive reform.
