title: "Ruleset: Negotiations"
toc: true
---

A negotiation begins when the heroes ask something of an NPC and the DM deems that the circumstances require a negotiation. During negotiation, the DM assigns NPCs four temporary statistics — **interest**, **patience**, **motivations**, and **pitfalls**.  

The heroes can strike a favorable deal if they maximize an NPC’s interest by making arguments that invoke the NPC’s motivations and avoid their pitfalls — but they have to do all that before the NPC’s patience wears out.

## Interest
An NPC's **interest** shows how eager they are to make a deal with the heroes.  

- Ranges from **0 (no interest)** to **5 (maximum interest)**  
- NPCs start between **1 and 4**  
- **Interest 5**: NPC makes their final offer and ends the negotiation  
- **Interest 0**: NPC ends negotiations without making a deal  

The heroes' arguments can increase or decrease an NPC's interest.

## Patience
An NPC's **patience** represents how much time and effort they'll devote to a negotiation.  

- Ranges from **0 to 5** (always starts above 0)  
- **Patience 0**: NPC makes a final offer and ends the negotiation  

> Patience may decrease each time the heroes make an argument.

### Language and Patience
Speaking the NPC's native language (excluding Common) increases their initial patience:  

- **1 hero** speaking it → +1 Patience  
- **3+ heroes** speaking it → +2 Patience  
- Maximum patience is **5**

## Motivations
Each NPC has at least **two motivations** that heroes can appeal to.  

- Appealing to a motivation → Easier skill check to increase interest  
- Ignoring motivations → Harder skill check  
- Each motivation can only be successfully appealed to **once per negotiation**  
- To succeed:  
  - Use the motivation in an argument  
  - Avoid mentioning pitfalls  
  - Avoid being caught in a lie  

## Pitfalls
Pitfalls trigger **negative responses** (anger, discomfort, shame, fear).  

- Using a pitfall in an argument → NPC’s **interest and patience both decrease**  
- Every NPC has at least one pitfall  
- Pitfalls and motivations can overlap (what motivates one NPC might offend another)  

**Examples of Motivations & Pitfalls:**  
- Benevolence  
- Discovery  
- Freedom  
- Greed  
- Higher Authority  
- Justice  
- Legacy  
- Peace  
- Power  
- Protection  
- Revelry  
- Vengeance  

## Uncovering Motivations
Heroes can try to discover motivations or pitfalls during negotiation:  

- Ask directly: “What do you want out of this deal?”  
- NPCs may hint at or reveal a motivation  
- If not forthcoming, a skill check (often **Insight**) can be made:  

| Roll | Outcome |
|------|----------|
| 10 or lower | Learn nothing, -1 Patience |
| 11–15 | Learn nothing |
| 16+ | Learn one **motivation or pitfall** (hero’s choice) |

> After this, no further checks can be made until the heroes make an argument or the negotiation ends.

## Making Arguments

### Appeal to Motivation
If the argument:  
- **Avoids pitfalls**  
- **Uses an unappealed motivation**  

Then the hero makes an **easy skill check** (often Charisma + skill like Persuasion, History, Survival).  

**Outcomes:**  
- 10 or lower: -1 Patience  
- 11–15: +1 Interest, -1 Patience  
- 16+: +1 Interest  

> Well-roleplayed arguments might succeed automatically.  
> Appealing to the same motivation again = no change in Interest, -1 Patience.

---

### No Motivation or Pitfall
If an argument uses neither:  

**Outcomes:**  
- 10 or lower: -1 Interest, -1 Patience  
- 11–15: -1 Patience  
- 16+: +1 Interest, -1 Patience  
- Natural 20: +1 Interest  

---

### Pitfall Used
- Automatic failure  
- -1 Interest, -1 Patience  
- NPC may warn the heroes  

---

### Caught in a Lie
If a failed argument was a lie:  
- NPC detects it → -1 Interest (in addition to other penalties)

---

### Fame / Infamy
Fame or infamy affects Persuasion/Intimidation checks:  

- **Famous** to NPC → Advantage on Persuasion  
- **Infamous** to NPC → Advantage on Intimidation  

A hero is famous/infamous if their renown > NPC’s.  

**Renown chart:**  
- Brigand leader, commoner, shop owner  
- Knight, local guildmaster, professor  
- Cult leader, local mage, noble lord  
- Assassin, baron, local entertainer  
- Guard Captain, high priest, viscount  
- Count, warlord  
- Marquis, world-renowned entertainer  
- Duke, spymaster  
- Archmage, prince  
- Demon lord, monarch  
- Archdevil, archfey, demigod  
- Deity, titan  

## Keep Going or Stop
- If NPC still has **Patience > 0** and **Interest 1–4** → heroes can continue or accept current offer  
- If NPC has **Patience 0** or **Interest 5** → NPC makes final offer (heroes may accept or refuse, but negotiation ends)  
- If **Interest 0** → NPC refuses deal outright  
- Heroes can walk away at any time  

## NPC Response and Offer
After an argument, NPCs react:  

- **Positive** → Interest increases  
- **Negative** → Interest decreases  
- **Impatient** → No change in Interest  

> Unless deceitful, NPCs should make it clear if an argument helped, hurt, or was neutral.  

### Offers by Interest
- **5 — Yes, and…** NPC grants request **+ bonus**  
- **4 — Yes** NPC grants request  
- **3 — Yes, but…** NPC grants request **with a catch**  
- **2 — No, but…** NPC refuses but offers alternative  
- **1 — No** NPC refuses outright  
- **0 — No, and…** NPC refuses **and worsens situation**
