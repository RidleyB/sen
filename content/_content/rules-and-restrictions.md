## House Rules

### Hidden Death Saves
The DM rolls death saving throws for unconscious characters, only informing of the result upon death, or revival.

### Better Health Potions
You may spend a bonus action to drink a potion to gain it's regular effects. You may also choose to spend a standard action to drink a potion. If you do so this way, you instead heal the max amount of hit points the health potion provides.

### Negate Fall Damage
If you fall 10ft, roll a DC 10 dexterity save. On a success saving throw, you negate the fall damage.

### Turn Delay
At the start of your turn, you may choose to delay your turn instead, pushing your initiative further down the list. If you delay your turn, you cannot delay it past the bottom of the initiative order. If you have an active spell that ends or activates on your turn and you choose to delay your turn, the spell acts as if your turn occurred at the initiative order you cast the spell at.

### D10 For Initiative
When rolling initiative, use 1d10 instead of 1d20 for the roll. Add your modifier to it, as usual.

### Push the Roll
When you fail a skill check, you may choose to attempt the skill check again, by "pushing" the roll. If you fail on the second attempt, something bad will happen, at the DM's discretion. You may only push a roll once per day, regardless of outcome.
