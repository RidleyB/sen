# Rising Taxes Force Closure of Arcane Essentials
*Pothric Vojisat, Staff Reporter*

**SEN**— Arcane Essentials, a small but popular magical supply shop in Sen’s Market District, has permanently closed, citing steep new taxes and stricter import rules. Owner Loric Tevrin explained, “The costs have become unsustainable. Raising prices would have driven away the customers who’ve supported us for decades.”

Smaller merchants across the city face similar struggles, while larger trading houses and well-connected families can absorb the increased expenses. Critics warn that these policies, meant to encourage local production, may instead concentrate the magical supply market among the city’s wealthiest.

“Small shops are the lifeblood of Sen’s magical community,” said regular customer Arwen Drosil. “Without them, the city loses not just goods, but spaces for learning and experimentation.”

The closure of Arcane Essentials highlights the growing challenges for independent merchants and raises questions about the future accessibility and diversity of Sen’s magical trade.
