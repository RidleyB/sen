**Summary:** During standard operating hours on Solimnis the 3rd approximately 2:56pm, a coordinated heist was carried out at the central market in Sen's inner ring. The operatives, believed to be working under the Violet Lady's direction, made off with materials totalling upwards of 10,000gp, leaving behind a trail of damaged property. Following the heist, violet petals were distributed in the streets from rooftops.

**Findings:**

- The operatives gained access to the market by posing as merchants and vendors, blending in with the regular market activity. They utilized a combination of stealth and enchantment to bypass security, followed by terror tactics once they had been discovered. Hostages were taken to coerce others, which proved effective.

- The stolen items include a variety of magical materials and relics. Notably, these items possess significant magical power and could be dangerous in the wrong hands. 

- Several witnesses reported seeing figures in violet robes moving swiftly through the market after the heist was discovered. Their presence was confirmed by the petals scattered through the streets, a signature of the Violet Lady.

- Among the scattered petals, investigators found a torn pieces of cloth from a violet robes. Discarded weaponry indicates the Violet Lady conspirators are well-supplied. These items have been preserved for further analysis.

**Leads:**

- Follow-up with Halford's aide who found him- corroborate story with others from Halford's estate. 
- Follow-up with botanist- potential lead sourcing where the petal originated.

**Preliminary Conclusions:** The selection of high-value magical artifacts suggests a deliberate and targeted theft, likely for specific purposes rather than random looting.

**Recommendations:**

- Increase surveillance and security measures in all major markets and trade centers within Sen.
- Collaborate with local merchants and vendors to establish a comprehensive list of the magical materials stolen.
- Launch an extensive search for the stolen artifacts to prevent their misuse and potential threat to public safety. Coordinate with Council of Discretion
