**SEN**— The streets of Sen will come alive next weekend as the Blanchard family hosts the annual Tayiri Lantern Festival, a celebration honoring the ancient Owlin people known as the Tayiri.

The two-day festival features the famed Flight of Flame performances, where skilled Tayiri dancers light up the evening with fire and movement under the Blanchards’ patronage. The event culminates in a grand lantern-lighting ceremony, releasing thousands of glowing lanterns into the night sky as a symbol of unity and remembrance.

“This festival celebrates our connection to the Tayiri and our city’s shared history,” said Oliander Fen, spokesperson for the Blanchard family. “We invite all residents to participate, whether in honor of loved ones or simply to make a wish.”

The Tayiri Lantern Festival remains one of Sen’s most cherished traditions, promising a spectacle of culture, art, and communal reflection.
