Long ago, the people of the ancient world of Qon constructed a city at the convergence of a series of arcane gateways. These gateways opened a bridge across the universe, connecting countless worlds together with Sen at its heart. 

Centuries later, Sen exists now as a sprawling metropolis that stands as a testament to diversity and cultural unity. Its streets wind through districts teeming with life, its towering spires piercing the sky, and its bustling markets offering goods from every culture. From the opulent halls of its noble houses to the crooked alleys of its more crowded boroughs, Sen pulses with the vibrant energy of progress and innovation.

Renowned as an epicenter of culture, technology, and politics, Sen is a beacon of civilization in an ever-changing universe Its universities attract the brightest scholars and mages, its bustling markets offer the latest marvels of modern invention, and its grandest theaters host fantastic performances. Here, ideas are born, alliances are forged, and the course of history is shaped by the actions of its diverse inhabitants.

Too large to be governed by one centralized government, the city has broken up its governance throughout large connections of boroughs, each controlled by different families. These families are thought of by the people in most cases as essential, as their wealth, influence, and leadership is invaluable in steering the course of their home's history. While some cry out against the opulent displays of wealth possessed by the aristocratic families of Sen, the benefits of these families greatly outweigh the posed negatives. The people remain happy, their voices heard, and the city safe and prosperous. The positions of leadership held by these noble houses each wield considerable power and authority in Sen's complex political landscape, differing from place to place.

## The Five Families

Our story surrounds five of these great families; the prestigious Santini family, and four other political families operating in their section of the city. Together, the five families all hold a significant share of influence where our story takes place, all vying for power in the area and looking to expand further. Each family has their own interests at heart, carefully navigating an increasingly unstable political landscape. Recently, a growing destabilizing threat has emerged, threatening violence and terror throughout the streets. The families can no longer ignore this presence, and a grand gala event has been called to formally address the growing threat of this dark player, "The Violet Lady".

# Main Characters

The [Santini Family](/factions/the-santini-family) family is large and filled with gifted and skilled individuals, nearly all singular in their talents. At its head is Viola Santini, matriarch and head of all the family's operations. In the absence of their late father, Salvatore Russo, their children have stepped up to each manage their own sections of the Santini dynasty:

> ## [Viola Santini](/characters/viola-santini)
> Viola Santini, the revered matriarch of the Santini family, commands respect and adoration in equal measure. Known for her grace, wisdom, and unwavering devotion to her family, she is a formidable presence in city of Sen.
> ## [Salvatore Russo](/characters/salvatore-russo)
> Salvatore commanded a prominent presence in Sen's aristocracy until his passing nearly a decade ago. He was a respected figure in Sen's social circles, known for his contributions to the city's cultural endeavors.
> ## [Francesca Santini](/characters/francesca-santini)
> The eldest child of Viola Santini. Skilled in both combat and diplomacy, Francesca is a formidable presence in both the boardroom and the battlefield. She manages the family's businesses and serves as a lead enforcer in the Santini boroughs.
> ## [Giovanna Santini](/characters/giovanna-santini)
> Second eldest child of Viola Santini. Gifted with a sharp mind for numbers and negotiation, Giovanna oversees the family's finances and investments, skillfully managing their wealth. Her ambitious nature and keen business acumen drive her pursuit of wealth and power within Sen's aristocracy.
> ## [Alessia Santini](/characters/alessia-santini)
> Middle child of Viola Santini. Alessia is the epitome of grace and charm, often seen at the most exclusive gatherings. While she appears to live a life of luxury and leisure, Alessia is highly adept at networking and handling the family's social connections.
> ## [Luciano Santini](/characters/luciano-santini)
> Second youngest child of Viola Santini. The only son of Viola, Luciano is often regarded as the black sheep of the family. He is disinterested and ineffectual when it comes to family affairs, lacking ambition and the necessary skills to involve himself in the family's enterprises.
> ## [Caterina Santini](/characters/caterina-santini)
> Youngest child of Viola Santini. The youngest daughter of the Santini family, Caterina is known for her ability to handle herself in delicate situations with finesse and grace. She is new to the political scene, emerging with her newlywed husband Fabrizio de Luca.

Among the [Santinis](/factions/santini-family) are a number of neighboring families, all players in the political scene, vying for power amongst the boroughs of Sen. Each family will play a role in the story, some large and some small. The [Blanchards](/factions/blanchard-family), the [Del Vecchios](/factions/del-vecchio-family), the [Montaignes](/factions/montaigne-family), and the [Reinhardts](/factions/reinhardt-family) will all be in attendance at the grand gala, spreading their influence and socializing with the city's elite. Each family has their own involvement with the Santinis, and their own agendas they're pushing for.

## The Violet Lady

An enigmatic, shadowy figure, whose true motives and origins remain shrouded in mystery. Recent events have seen a surge in precise attacks throughout the city, targeting warehouses and facilities containing valuable magical materials with alarming frequency. Further reports have surfaced of necromantic disturbances affecting the interests of not only the Santini family, but their allies in the Blanchard and Del Vecchio clans as well. Lastly, whispers of cultist activity and missing persons following these events have begun to spread. With no arrests have been made, no reports of anyone having even seen this Violet Lady figure, and little evidence of their presence, the city's residents have begun speculating wildly on the true nature of these dark forces at work. 

Despite the escalating threat posed by the Violet Lady and her nefarious activities, the response from the great families of Sen has been notably muted. While rumors and whispers of the Violet Lady's actions circulate throughout the city, the great families have thus far been slow to act; this lackluster response has left many residents of Sen feeling vulnerable and exposed, as they look to the Santini family and their allies for leadership and guidance in these troubled times. Some speculate that there are those in the great families that know the true identity of the Violet Lady and refuse to come forward, likely benefiting somehow. 

Following numerous accusations all seeming to stem from a unfortunate similarity between her name and the criminal, some have even gone so far to suggest Viola Santini as a possible kingpin to the string of crimes, to which Viola responded by releasing her daily schedule to the public with a foreword.
> "If you can find the time for masterminding an entire criminal conspiracy in my schedule someplace, I might consider this a valid accusation." - Viola Santini

### Tips

Finally, here are some tips to consider when building your character. 

- Strongly consider making a character that will be interested (at least in some sense) in dealing with the Santini family. Their fate will be tied with yours in this story, so playing a character who couldn't care less about them might not work very well for you!
- While this is a story of political intrigue, be prepared for combat as much as social encounters. Dangers abound! Just as I hope your barbarian can charm the pants off of a politician, I hope your socialite can take a fireball or two.
