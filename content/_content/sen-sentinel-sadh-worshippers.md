# City in Peril! The Violet Lady’s Cult Strikes Again!
*Ariadne Vodenifor, Investigative Reporter*

**SEN**— The Celestial City reels in fear as a wave of criminal and cult activity sweeps across its streets, all pointing to one mysterious figure: the infamous Violet Lady. Long whispered about in the corridors of power, the Violet Lady has now become the face of a deeply rooted cult of “Sadh” worshippers, infiltrating every level of the city’s government and high society.

Recent events have left Sen on edge. The shocking assassination of Magistrate Halford—a man known for his tireless fight against corruption—was marked only by a single violet petal left at the scene. Just days later, the Astra Archives, a bastion of the city’s history and knowledge, went up in flames. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen figures in violet robes fleeing the blaze. And in one of the boldest moves yet, the Open Market Heist stripped the central marketplace of rare magical artifacts, leaving petals raining down from building rooftops—a chilling signature that authorities now associate with the cult.

But this is no ordinary criminal syndicate. Sources suggest the Sadh worshippers operate under the Violet Lady’s direction, performing midnight rituals, abducting prominent citizens, and desecrating sacred temples throughout Sen. Citizens have reported seeing hooded figures, their faces obscured, carrying out arcane rites and marking holy sites with ominous symbols. Some missing individuals are feared sacrificed or forcibly inducted into the cult, though the full extent of the Violet Lady’s network remains unknown.

The city’s leadership faces a perilous challenge: how to contain a threat that is both insidiously embedded in positions of power and ruthlessly efficient in execution. The Violet Lady’s shadow looms large, and the once-mighty city of Sen is forced to confront the terrifying possibility that this cult’s influence has been festering for years, hidden behind the veneer of civility and governance.

Citizens are urged to remain vigilant. Report any suspicious activity to the city guard immediately.

*“The Violet Lady is not just a criminal. She is a symbol of something far more sinister,” warns one anonymous government official. “A network that touches every corner of Sen, from the marketplace to the council chambers. We are fighting an enemy we can barely see.”*
