# Incident Report #EM432-392
**Date:** EM/432/5/21 <br>
**Time of Incident:** ~6:32am <br>
**Investigator on Site:** Sparrow <br>
**Report:** Chief Magistrate Halford assassinated, suspected murderer is an associate of the Violet Lady.<br>

---

**Summary:** Magistrate Halford was found dead in his private chambers, approximately 6:32 AM. The scene presented no evidence of forced entry or a struggle, indicating a premeditated and meticulously executed assassination. A single violet petal was discovered on the magistrate's desk, consistent with the calling card of the individual known as the Violet Lady.

**Findings:**

- No signs of forced entry were detected- the chamber's security measures were not breached, implying the use of magical means or inside knowledge of the estate's layout and routines.
   
- Initial examination suggests cause of death to be poisoning, as no external injuries were found. Further analysis by our alchemists is underway to identify the specific toxin used.

- Violet petal left at scene is identical to those previously attributed to the Violet Lady cult. The petal has been preserved for further analysis to trace its origins.

- Interviews with household staff revealed no unusual activity on the night of the assassination. However, one guard reported a fleeting shadow near the magistrate's chambers around midnight. The guard's name was taken down for further surveillance.

**Leads:**

- Follow-up with Halford's aide who found him- corroborate story with others from Halford's estate. 
- Follow-up with botanist- potential lead sourcing where the petal originated.

**Preliminary Conclusions:** The calling card strongly suggests the involvement of the Violet Lady. The lack of forced entry points to either magical infiltration or complicity from within the household.

**Recommendations:**

- Increase surveillance and security measures for high-profile targets.
- Enhance magical defenses against unauthorized entry.
- Pursue leads related to the Violet Lady's network and known associates.
