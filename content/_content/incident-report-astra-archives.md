# Incident Report #EM432-361
**Date:** EM/432/12/05 <br>
**Time of Incident:** ~3:38am <br>
**Investigator on Site:** Viper <br>
**Report:** Fire at the Astra Archives- extensive damage to nearly one third of the collected works. Some works suspected missing.<br>

---

**Summary:** In the early hours of the 12th of Midyear, a fire broke out at the Astra Archives causing extensive damage and loss of invaluable historical and magical documents. Eyewitnesses reported seeing individuals cloaked in robes fleeing the scene shortly before the fire erupted, implying an act of arson.

**Findings:**

- Initial assessments indicate that the fire was started using a highly flammable magical accelerant, placed to ensure maximum destruction. Traces of this substance were found at multiple ignition points throughout the archives.

- Eyewitness Accounts: Several eyewitnesses, including scholars and archivists, reported seeing figures in violet robes near the archives just before the fire started. Their descriptions match known associates of the Violet Lady.

- Restricted Texts: The fire appears to have been concentrated in areas housing restricted magical texts, which are heavily regulated by Sen's magic laws. Many of these texts are now presumed lost, raising questions about the motive behind the attack.

- Evidence Recovered: Amidst the charred remains, investigators found a violet petal and a fragment of a robe consistent with those worn by the Violet Lady's followers. These items have been preserved for further analysis.

**Leads:**

- Speak with lead archivist about missing texts for clues about motive.
- This isn't isolated- we should expect more attacks on places like this in the future.

**Preliminary Conclusions:** The evidence strongly suggests that the fire was a deliberate act of sabotage orchestrated by the Violet Lady or her followers. The focus on restricted magical texts implies a specific motive related to the control and dissemination of magical knowledge.

**Recommendations:**

- Increase security measures around other key repositories of knowledge and magical artifacts in Sen.
- Follow-up with Collegium about moving similar texts to safer repositories- perhaps the Vault of Antiquities.
- Intensify efforts to identify and apprehend members of the Violet Lady's network.
