# Guild of Discovery Rocked: Demivin’s Secret Life Exposed!
*Ariadne Vodenifor, Investigative Reporter*

**SEN**— The venerable Demivin, famed explorer and respected member of the Guild of Discovery, now finds his sterling reputation under scrutiny. Sources at a recent social event report an unusual detail: a single black feather tucked into Demivin’s otherwise immaculate plumage—a subtle symbol allegedly tied to a secretive society known for indulgent and hedonistic gatherings.

Eyewitnesses claim Demivin was seen in hushed conversation with a mysterious figure, dubbed the “Demi's Shadow”, draped in lavish silks and glittering jewels. Their prolonged discussion, filled with knowing glances, has sparked speculation that Demivin may lead a double life, balancing his scholarly pursuits with clandestine revelry.

The Guild of Discovery, long celebrated for its contributions to exploration and knowledge, now faces internal turmoil, as members scramble to defend or distance themselves from one of their most esteemed figures.

While verification remains elusive, the Sen Sentinel warns: in Sen, appearances may be deceiving. Demivin’s silence only fans the flames of suspicion—leaving the city to wonder what secrets lie behind the scholar’s composed exterior.
