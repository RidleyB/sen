**Description**: Vordara is a militaristic world known for its strict discipline and combat prowess. The Giff originate from Vordara, where they developed a strong sense of duty and honor. However, they arrived in Sen as refugees, their homeworld left in ruins by the murderous Thri-kreen. Today, the Giff are slowly rebuilding their homeland while maintaining their tradition of strength and strategy. This world is characterized by its well-organized societies, fortresses, and a culture that values resilience and tactical excellence.
