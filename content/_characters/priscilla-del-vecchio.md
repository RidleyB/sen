title: Priscilla Del Vecchio

faction:
  sort: "Del Vecchio"
  sort-role: "Once the wife of Ettore Del Vecchio, Priscilla lived through the family’s fall from grace. Though from a lesser-known family herself, she bore the brunt of her husband’s scandals until her death."

standings:
  - name: "Del Vecchio"
    desc: "Priscilla’s life was defined by the family’s decline. She spent her later years in quiet shame, hidden from public view as Ettore’s reputation poisoned their household. Her death closed that chapter, though her memory lingers as a reminder of what the Del Vecchios once were."
  - name: "Other Families"
    desc: "In Sen’s noble circles, Priscilla was largely forgotten. Mention of her name often carries with it pity at best, derision at worst — a symbol of the Del Vecchio family’s lowest point."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Priscilla was gentle but withdrawn, known more for her silence than her presence. In her youth she was said to be warm and kind, but years of public disgrace left her quiet, almost spectral in family gatherings."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Priscilla married Ettore Del Vecchio with the promise of stability, only to find herself dragged into scandal after scandal. By the time of her death, she lived secluded from Sen’s public life, her health worn down by stress and shame. She left behind children and grandchildren who inherited the weight of her husband’s failures."
