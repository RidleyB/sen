faction:
  sort: "Reinhardt"
  given: "Reinhardt"
  given-role: "Fritz Reinhardt is the betrothed of Elena Del Vecchio. Though the union promises prestige and strategic advantage for both families, it is shrouded in controversy due to past conflicts involving Francesca Santini and Karl Reinhardt. The familial entanglements have placed additional strain on Sofia Del Vecchio, sister of Viola Santini, who views her daughter's betrothal to a Reinhardt with great distress."

standings:
  - name: "Santini"
    desc: "The Reinhardtâ€“Santini relationship is precarious, made worse by the history between Francesca Santini and Karl Reinhardt. Fritz himself carries this weight, seen as a living reminder of that fraught legacy. This casts suspicion and bitterness on his betrothal to Elena Del Vecchio, further upsetting the Santini branch of the family."
  - name: "Del Vecchio"
    desc: "The Del Vecchio family's acceptance of Fritz is cautious and strained. Sofia Del Vecchio, Elena's mother and sister to Viola Santini, harbors deep unease about the arrangement, torn between duty to her family's future and resentment toward the Reinhardts. Elena herself is caught between loyalty to her mother and the practical weight of the union."
  - name: "Reinhardt"
    desc: "Within the Reinhardt family, Fritz is seen as a dutiful son who advances the family's strategic ties. His betrothal to Elena is viewed as a calculated alliance, part of the Reinhardts' broader political maneuvers. He is supported by Friedrich Reinhardt as an important piece in securing their legacy."
  - name: "Blanchard"
    desc: "The Blanchards, long rivals of the Reinhardts, are outwardly indifferent to Fritz's union but subtly exploit the controversy to weaken Reinhardt credibility. Their quiet manipulations often fan the flames of Santini and Del Vecchio discontent."
  - name: "Montaigne"
    desc: "The Montaigne family views the match with pragmatic interest. To them, the union symbolizes the shifting tides of alliances in Sen, though they are wary of the drama surrounding Santini involvement."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Fritz is earnest and idealistic, but caught in the web of political machinations far greater than himself. Unlike many Reinhardts, he lacks ruthlessness, often displaying a softer demeanor that makes him more approachable-but also more vulnerable. He strives to balance his family's expectations with his own sense of fairness and compassion."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Privately, Fritz seeks genuine companionship with Elena, though the shadow of the Santini-Reinhardt feud looms heavily over them. He is aware of Sofia Del Vecchio's distress but feels powerless to alter the course set by his family. This conflict often weighs on him, leaving him conflicted between personal affection and familial duty."
  - title: "Role in the Family"
    element: "Though not the central figure of Reinhardt power, Fritz's engagement represents a significant political move orchestrated by his elders. His role is less about his personal ambitions and more about serving as a living bridge between Reinhardt and Del Vecchio interests-whether he desires it or not."
