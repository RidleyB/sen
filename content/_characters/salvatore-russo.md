title: Salvatore Russo
dead: true

faction:
  sort: "Santini"
  sort-role: "Through his marriage to Viola Santini, Salvatore played an integral role in shaping the Santini household’s image. He never held the reins of power himself but served as a tempering influence on Viola’s commanding nature."
  given: "Russo"
  given-role: "Born to the Russo line, a modest but respected family, Salvatore’s marriage into the Santinis elevated his position and bound his legacy to Sen’s most prominent house."

standings:
  - name: "Santini"
    desc: "Salvatore was deeply loved within the Santini family. His gentle hand and warm outlook softened Viola’s often rigid approach, helping shape her reputation throughout the city. His absence has been felt strongly in the last decade, as Viola’s colder edge has returned without him by her side."
  - name: "Other Families"
    desc: "Salvatore was broadly respected across the noble houses. Even rivals acknowledged his kindness and diplomacy, which often made negotiations with the Santinis less contentious during his lifetime."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Salvatore was warm, approachable, and generous with his time. He possessed a quiet wisdom, preferring listening to lecturing, and was often the calm presence that kept volatile meetings from spiraling into conflict."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "His marriage to Viola was both political and personal. Though it strengthened the Santinis’ ties to the Russo family, it also brought out a side of Viola rarely seen in public — a softer, more loving figure. Together they raised their children under a balance of discipline and compassion. Salvatore’s sudden death in his fifties from illness, devastated the household."
  - title: "Legacy"
    element: "In death, Salvatore became an almost mythic figure among Sen’s commonfolk. Many remember him as the reason Viola’s iron will was tempered into benevolence, the influence that transformed her into the 'Mother of Sen.' His absence is still felt: without him, Viola has withdrawn toward her sterner roots, and the family’s warmth has dimmed with his passing."
