He has a knack for turning tense situations into light-hearted moments, often diffusing conflicts with humor or a well-placed compliment. However, his outspokenness can sometimes land him in trouble, as he's not one to shy away from sharing his opinions, even when they're unpopular."

As the second eldest of the four De Luca brothers, he has always had a strong sense of responsibility toward the family business, though he enjoys the perks of wealth more than the day-to-day grind.

Despite his loud demeanor, Angelo is loyal to his family and cares deeply for his brothers."
