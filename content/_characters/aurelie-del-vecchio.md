title: Aurelie Del Vecchio
faction: 
  sort: Del-Vecchio
  given: Montaigne
  sort-role: "Aurelie's role in the Del Vecchio family extends beyond that of a wife and mother. As a talented sorceress, she brought magic into the family. Her early contributions to the Collegium, a respected institution of magical learning, helped establish her as a formidable intellect in the field. However, Aurelie withdrew from public magical practice and ceased her publications around the time the Del Vecchios faced allegations of corruption during the era of Ettore Del Vecchio. Since then, she has focused on maintaining the family's integrity and reputation, working tirelessly to distance them from the shadows of the past."

standings:
  - name: "Santini"
    desc: "Aurelie respects the Santini family for their strong values and unwavering loyalty to their own. Though not particularly close, she maintains a courteous relationship with them, understanding the importance of mutual respect in Sen's aristocracy."
  - name: "Del Vecchio"

  - name: "Reinhardt"
    desc: "As the sister of Camille Reinhardt, Aurelie shares a close bond with the Reinhardt family. Her relationship with Camille has helped smooth relations between the Reinhardts and the Del Vecchios, fostering a strong alliance between the two families."
  - name: "Montaigne"
    desc: "Being a Montaigne by birth, Aurelie naturally maintains a strong allegiance to her brother Henri and the Montaigne family. Her ties to the Montaignes have been instrumental in bolstering the Del Vecchio's position in Sen's aristocratic circles."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Aurelie Del Vecchio was once known for her bright and energetic demeanor, bringing warmth and light to those around her. As a young woman she was full of life, with a passion for magic that was admired among the Montaigne family. However, the weight of scandal and the responsibility of maintaining her family's integrity have since tempered her outward disposition. In public, Aurelie presents a composed and resolute figure, demonstrating the strength and fortitude necessary to uphold the Del Vecchio name. Despite this steely exterior, those closest to her -her husband, daughter, and siblings- still see glimpses of the kind and compassionate woman she once was."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Aurelie is married to Alessandro Del Vecchio, with whom she has a daughter, Gabriella. As a sister to Henri Montaigne, she maintains strong familial ties, which have proven invaluable in keeping the Montaigne and Del Vecchio families united. Aurelie's inherent magical talent, a gift rare among Montaignes, brought a new dimension to the Del Vecchio family, which had previously lacked any magical prowess. Although her daughter Gabriella inherited this magical talent, she chose not to pursue it, opting instead to focus on other aspects of her life. Aurelie's relationship with her husband and daughter is strong, and she plays a significant role in guiding them through the complexities of Sen's aristocratic society."
