paragraphs:

  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Once considered for the Sacred Eye, Luciano's rebellious nature and issues with authority ended those prospects. His relationships and social interactions are often superficial, and he drifts through life without a clear purpose, much to the frustration of his family."
  - title: "Role in the Family"
    element: "As the only son, Luciano carries the Santini bloodline but fails to contribute meaningfully to its enterprises or reputation. While he is present at family events and maintains familial bonds, he is largely seen as a figure of untapped potential and personal disappointment."
