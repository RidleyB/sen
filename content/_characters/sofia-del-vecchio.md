title: Sofia Del Vecchio

faction:
  sort: "Del Vecchio"
  sort-role: "As wife of Marco Del Vecchio, Sofia holds a prominent position in the Del Vecchio household. Her Santini heritage gives her leverage and influence, though her loyalties are constantly questioned."
  given: "Santini"
  given-role: "Born a Santini, sister to Viola and Paolo, Sofia was raised in one of Sen’s most powerful families. Her marriage into the Del Vecchios was made before the Del Vecchio controversy, which only seemed to elevate the problem."

standings:
  - name: "Del Vecchio"
    desc: "Sofia is both an asset and a source of tension within the Del Vecchio household. Her sharp wit and Santini prestige strengthen their position, but her temper and lingering Santini loyalties often complicate Alessandro and Marco’s careful diplomacy."
  - name: "Santini"
    desc: "As Viola and Paolo’s sister, Sofia’s bond with the Santinis is complicated. Viola never truly understood her sister integrating so deeply into a rival house, while others see her as a necessary bridge between families. Sofia's fury over Lena’s marriage to Fritz Reinhardt demonstrates just how deeply she still identifies with Santini grudges."
  - name: "Reinhardt"
    desc: "Sofia’s resentment of the Reinhardts runs deep, fueled both by the longstanding Santini feud and her daughter Lena’s engagement to Fritz Reinhardt. This union is one of the few things that can pierce her usually composed exterior and provoke open outrage."
  - name: "Other Families"
    desc: "Sofia maintains polite relations with the other great houses but rarely invests herself in their politics directly. Her focus remains on the tangled web between the Santinis, Del Vecchios, and Reinhardts."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Sofia is proud, fiery, and uncompromising. She carries herself with the elegance of her Santini heritage but wields her tongue like a blade. While not as calculating as her sister Viola, Sofia is every bit as forceful, and her temper often overrides diplomacy."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Married to Marco Del Vecchio, Sofia has built her life on balancing Santini prestige with Del Vecchio pragmatism. She is fiercely protective of her children, Luca and Lena, and her loyalties often clash when family choices pull her between houses. Her fury at Lena’s marriage to Fritz Reinhardt has left her relationship with her daughter bitter and strained."
  - title: "Role in the Family"
    element: "Sofia embodies the uneasy marriage between Santini and Del Vecchio interests. While she strengthens the Del Vecchio name by lending it Santini credibility, she also risks undermining them by dragging her old grudges into new conflicts. Within the household, her word carries weight — sometimes more than Marco’s — especially in matters involving her children."
  - title: "Closeness to the Story"
    element: "Sofia’s actions and temper ripple through the narrative. Her loyalties and grudges threaten the fragile balance between Sen’s great houses, making her one of the most volatile and unpredictable figures in the Del Vecchio line."
