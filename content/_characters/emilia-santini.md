  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Emilia Santini is a lively and spirited child with a boundless energy that seems to overflow from every part of her being. At just 9 years old, she is already known for her mischievous nature and her ability to turn even the most mundane activities into an adventure. Emilia is not one to sit still for long, and her dislike for the rigid expectations of high society is apparent. She much prefers the outdoors, where she can run free and explore to her heart's content. Her playful demeanor often gets her into trouble, but her charm usually helps her find a way out of it."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Born to Giovanna and Etienne, Emilia is a child who thrives on curiosity and exploration. Despite her intelligence, Emilia struggles to focus in a traditional classroom setting, where she finds it difficult to apply herself to studies that do not capture her interest. Instead, she prefers spending her time in the gardens, working alongside the gardeners and learning about plants and nature. This hands-on approach to learning suits her much better than the confines of a classroom, and it is in these moments that her natural intelligence shines through."
