title: Emilia Santini

faction:
  sort: "Santini"
  given: "Santini"
  given-role: "As the young daughter of Giovanna Santini and Etienne Blanchard, Emilia has yet to take on any formal role within the family. Instead, her presence is that of spirited disruption - a child who resists the trappings of aristocratic life and prefers the freedom of gardens and open air to the formality of parlors and staterooms."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Emilia Santini is a whirlwind of energy, curiosity, and mischief. Rarely still, she delights in climbing trees, chasing after the gardeners, and finding ways to test the patience of her tutors. Though intelligent, Emilia has little interest in sitting still long enough to apply herself to lessons. Her distracted nature frustrates her teachers, but those who watch her closely recognize a keen mind - one that simply prefers exploration to structure. Emilia's disdain for high-society expectations is already evident; she finds the stiff etiquette of her parents' world dull and stifling, gravitating instead to the freedom of the outdoors."

  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Raised between the Santini and Blanchard households, Emilia is already showing signs of how difficult it may be for her to adapt to the expectations of her family's station. Though still very much a child, she actively resists the refined lifestyle intended for her, preferring mud on her shoes and dirt under her fingernails. In the gardens, she is happiest- chatting with workers, learning their tricks, and pretending to command her own tiny kingdom of plants and creatures. Her parents worry that her unruly behavior will become harder to tame as she grows older, but others admire her free spirit, seeing in her a spark of individuality rare among Sen's noble children."
