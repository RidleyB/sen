title: Philippe Blanchard

faction:
  sort: "Blanchard"
  sort-role: "As patriarch of the Blanchard family, Philippe is a cunning political operator who thrives in Sen’s shifting currents of power. He has steered his family to prominence not through military might or mercantile strength, but through deft maneuvering and an uncanny sense for opportunity."

standings:
  - name: "Blanchard"
    desc: "Philippe commands his household with a calculating hand. He cultivates an image of refinement while encouraging his children and allies to pursue every advantage, no matter how subtle."
  - name: "Santini"
    desc: "Philippe maintains a cautious relationship with the Santinis. He respects Viola Santini’s command of aristocratic power but views the family as overconfident. He often positions himself as a neutral broker between their rivals, profiting from their conflicts."
  - name: "Del Vecchio"
    desc: "The Del Vecchios’ reform under Alessandro intrigued Philippe, though he retains some doubts their sincerity. He cultivates a working relationship with them, careful never to commit fully, so he can pivot should scandal resurface."
  - name: "Reinhardt"
    desc: "Philippe considers the Reinhardts too rigid in their sense of duty and honor. He admires their engineering and architectural skill but finds them predictable in politics."
  - name: "Montaigne"
    desc: "The Montaignes’ mercantile empire overlaps with Blanchard interests, making them both rivals and occasional partners. Philippe values their pragmatism but fears their influence if left unchecked."
  - name: "Other Factions"
    desc: "Philippe keeps tendrils in the Collegium, the Order of the Sacred Eye, and various minor guilds. While not overtly loyal to any, he buys influence where it can be leveraged."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Philippe is shrewd, urbane, and deeply pragmatic. He cloaks his ambitions behind charm and refinement, but beneath the surface lies a ruthless opportunist. He thrives on reading a room, shifting allegiances with ease, and exploiting the pride of more rigid rivals."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Philippe’s personal life is as political as his public one. His marriage cemented ties with minor houses, and he views his children as pieces on the board — heirs, bargaining chips, or weapons, depending on circumstance. He cultivates loyalty through a mix of calculated generosity and quiet intimidation."
  - title: "Role in the Family"
    element: "As patriarch, Philippe orchestrates the Blanchards’ every move in Sen. He favors subtle influence over open confrontation, weaving a network of favors, debts, and whispers that give his family leverage in matters where others would need armies or coin."
  - title: "Legacy"
    element: "Philippe’s goal is to secure the Blanchards as indispensable power-brokers in Sen. He does not care if they are loved or feared, only that they cannot be ignored. Whether his legacy is stability or scandal depends on how long his intricate web of influence can hold."
