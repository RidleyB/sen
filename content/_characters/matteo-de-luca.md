standings:

    desc: "Matteo is tolerated by his brothers more than respected. His reliability is questionable, but he is still family, and they find use for him in lesser duties."
  - name: "Santini"

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Matteo is bitter, insecure, and prone to excuses. Unlike his ambitious brothers, he lacks drive, often resenting their successes while contributing little of his own. He can be charming in short bursts but quickly reveals himself as lazy and unreliable."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Matteo lives off the scraps of the family’s merchant wealth, dabbling in minor trades but never sticking with anything long enough to matter. He relies on the De Luca name to maintain appearances and often latches onto Fabrizio and Caterina’s success for credibility."
  - title: "Role in the Family"
    element: "Among the brothers, Matteo is seen as the least capable. He avoids major responsibilities, preferring to pass them to others under the guise of being 'too busy' with minor errands. Despite this, he lingers on the edges of family affairs, always angling for some recognition he never truly earns."
