title: Phineas Reinhardt

faction:
  sort: "Reinhardt"
  sort-role: "The young son of Friedrich and Nina Reinhardt, Phineas represents Friedrich’s late attempt to secure the family line after Karl’s failed betrothal. His presence deepens divisions within the household."

standings:
  - name: "Reinhardt"
    desc: "Among the Reinhardts, Phineas is a source of contention. Friedrich dotes on him as proof the family’s future is secure, while Karl sees him as a pawn of Nina and a threat to their place in the line of succession."
  - name: "Santini"
    desc: "Though still too young to understand, Phineas’s existence is tied to the Reinhardt-Santini split. Many in the Santini family dismiss him as the product of Nina’s ambition, a living reminder of the marriage that fractured both houses."

paragraphs:
  - title: "Personality"
    element: "Phineas is still young, impressionable, and sheltered. He parrots Nina’s words and attitudes, which makes him come across as precocious but also manipulative in miniature. Whether this is genuine or simply mimicry is uncertain."
  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Raised in privilege, Phineas is closely guarded by Nina and largely shaped by her influence. Friedrich treats him with indulgent affection, blind to the way his presence inflames resentment in the rest of the family. Karl, in particular, keeps his distance, seeing Phineas less as a brother and more as the symbol of his father’s betrayal."
  - title: "Dynamic at Home"
    element: "Phineas’s place in the household is precarious. To Friedrich, he is hope for the Reinhardt line; to Nina, he is leverage; to Karl, he is an interloper. The boy grows up surrounded by tension, learning early that his very existence unsettles the home he lives in."
