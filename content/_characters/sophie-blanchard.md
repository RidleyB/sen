  - title: "Personal Life"
    element: "Much of Sophie’s personal life revolves around her children and her husband’s ambitions. She is devoted to Isabelle and Michel, but even her maternal role is colored by Philippe’s expectations. She often attends him at social functions, never far from his side."
