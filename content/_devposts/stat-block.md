**Overview**

The city of Sen, a grand celestial metropolis floating in the cosmos, stands as a beacon of unity and diversity. Established by the god Anzu and discovered by the Tayir, Sen has flourished into a hub of culture, magic, and commerce. The city's history is rich with eras of discovery, prosperity, strife, and modern complexities. In this vibrant setting, numerous factions vie for influence, including the Church of the Union, the Order of the Open Hand, and the enigmatic Violet Lady.

**Setting the Stage**

The campaign begins in Sen, where tensions simmer beneath the surface of its bustling streets. The city is a melting pot of races and cultures, thanks to the pioneering efforts of the Guild of Discovery. The Lord's Hands, the Order of the Sacred Eye, and other groups strive to maintain order and justice, while the Collegium Arcanum regulates the use of magic to preserve the city's delicate balance. However, dark forces and political intrigues threaten to unravel the harmony that Anzu envisioned.
