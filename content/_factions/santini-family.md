Viola's children each carved out a section of their family's dynasty for themselves. Each acts as a trusted advisor and counsel to Viola:

Francesca acts as the chief enforcer and strategic military counsel for Viola. She assists in maintaining the security of their estate, along with the enforcement interests they have in the various surrounding boroughs. 

Giovanna works closely with Sofia as chief financier and family treasurer. She ensures the family's financial interests are protected, and keeps a solid record of all of the family's assets and how to access them. 

Alessia acts as a diplomat for the family. Alongside her mother, the two navigate the social scene of Sen with strength and grace. Many say Alessia is the true successor to the Santini legacy, with her young boy as a prospective second. 

Luciano, the aloof and disappointing footnote of the Santini dynasty. Never showing a keen interest in much, Luciano loafs around the estate sticking his nose in everyone's business. He has a penchant for gossip and lies if it best suits a good story. 

Caterina, the blossoming flower of the Santini clan. Known for her beauty, artistry, and grace, she is fresh to the political scene, only recently showing her face alongside her newlywed husband Fabrizio de Luca. Following direction from her mother, Caterina has recently been more present in the family's social events, meshing herself within the aristocratic lifestyle she neglected in her youth.

# History

The recorded history of the Santini family traces back to a time before their arrival in Sen. According to legend, the Santinis bore a lineage of nobility and power, inherited from ancestors whose deeds and exploits long forgotten. In a time less connected by the [celestial city](/lore/sen-the-celestial-city) and shrouded in mystery, one of the family's founders, Antonio Santini, crossed paths with a powerful Djinni. In a high-stakes gamble that would alter the course of his family's destiny, the Antonio bested the Djinni in a contest of wits and cunning. Impressed by the mortal's audacity, the Djinni granted him a single wish, to be manifested through a magical artifact bestowed upon him- the [enchanted family seal](/lore/santini-family-seal) .

The true nature of the magic residing in the seal remains a closely guarded secret, known only to the most trusted members of the Santini family. While rumors abound regarding the magical powers imbued within the family seal, the full extent of its capabilities remains shrouded in mystery. Some whisper of wishes granted and miracles performed, while others speak of darker magic surrounding the seal. In truth, the power of the family seal lies dormant, its true potential untapped and unseen by mortal eyes for generations. For decades, the Santinis have wielded the seal with care and caution, allowing the influence of its legendary origin alone help carry their name to greatness. It remains on display in the estate, well protected and guarded constantly.

Throughout Sen's history, the Santini family have time and time again positioned themselves as prominent leaders of people, cunning merchants and shrewd diplomats. Throughout their history in the city, they have amassed a fortune large enough to secure their family for generations, while also working to also improve the lives of those within the city. 

Nearly a decade ago, tensions reached a boiling point between the Santini's and another prominent house, the Reinhardts. It plunged their section of the city into a period of political unrest, the conflict stemming from a political marriage gone awry. It was Viola Santini's daughter, Francesca, who was betrothed to [Friedrich Reinhardt's](/characters/friedrich-reinhardt) eldest son, [Karl](/characters/karl-reinhardt). The marriage quickly soured due to matters never disclosed, still both sides felt betrayed and wronged, each believing themselves justified in seeking reparations for any number of perceived slights and injustices.

As the feud escalated, the other political families watched with growing concern, recognizing the destabilizing effect it was having on Sen's political landscape. Among them was the [Montaigne family](/factions/the-montaigne-family), whose patriarch, [Henri Montaigne](/characters/henri-montaigne), saw the folly of allowing the conflict to escalate unchecked. With the wisdom born of years of experience, Henri approached both the Santini and Reinhardt families, urging them to set aside their differences and seek a peaceful resolution to their dispute. Realizing the potential consequences it would have for all involved, the Santini and Reinhardt families reluctantly agreed to enter into an arbitration process overseen by mediators chosen from among Sen's most respected elders. After months of negotiations and deliberations, a tentative peace was finally brokered between the warring factions, and the feud that had once threatened to tear Sen apart was brought to an end. The marriage was annulled, and Francesca and Karl remain unwed to this day.

In more recent years, the Santini family has found themselves navigating a web of external pressures and shifting alliances as they strive to maintain their position of power within the city of Sen. The sudden emergence of the enigmatic figure, [the Violet Lady"](/characters/the-violet-lady), has added a new layer of complexity to the Santini family's predicament, as rumors swirl of a dark force working in the shadows to destabilize Sen's political landscape. As they navigate these treacherous waters, the Santini family remains vigilant, ever wary of the dangers lurking in the shadows and determined to protect their legacy at all costs.

# Politics

Throughout the years, the Santini's have expressed a number of political ideologies through their governance of Sen's boroughs:

<div class="tab">
<h2 id="conservatism">Conservatism</h2>
The Santini's prefer to uphold traditional values and institutions, favoring stability and gradual change over rapid reform.
<br>

<h2 id="regionalism">Regionalism</h2>
The individual governance of the boroughs throughout the entirety of Sen is what gives the Santini's their power and influence- they seek to root out any progress to centralize government throughout the city, touting logistical issues with managing a body of people that large.
<br>

<h2 id="secularism">Secularism</h2>
Coupled with their views of centralized government, The Santini's prefer to keep religion out of politics, and prefer the separation of church and state. They believe any centralized government imposed on the city could come directly from the Order of the Open Hand, the largest religious group and one of the largest factions in the city. This poses concerns for many of the city's citizens who don't strictly worship Anzu, or don't want to see widespread rule imposed by a religious body.
<br>

<h2 id="militarism">Militarism</h2>
The Santini's have long had a capable cadre of enforcers that police the boroughs they control and imposing the laws of the city-wide ordinances as well as municipal law, as determined by the city's elite in conjunction with city elders.
