## History

### Foundation and Early Years
The Guild of Discovery was founded during the height of the era of discovery, a time when Sen was eager to expand its horizons and connect with new civilizations. The guild attracted the bravest and most adventurous souls, who were drawn to the promise of exploring uncharted territories and making first contact with alien cultures. These pioneers operated under a strict code of conduct to ensure respectful and peaceful engagements with new worlds, fostering relationships that would enrich Sen's society.

### Dangerous Work
The work of the Discovery pioneers was fraught with peril. They ventured into potentially hazardous planets, braving extreme climates, hostile creatures, and unfamiliar magic. The guild's members were skilled in various disciplines, including combat, diplomacy, and survival, to navigate these challenges and ensure the success of their missions. Many adventurers perished or were lost in the vast expanse of the cosmos, becoming legends and heroes whose tales inspired future generations.

> "Day 15 stranded at sea. We've seen a number of vessels on the horizon now, but have been unable to hail their attention for rescue...if they even would. We just need to hold out a few more days, until resupply attempts to establish contact. Until then... we're on quarter rations. What I wouldn't give for a nice roast chicken... or maybe one of those gulls that won't shut their beaks!"

### Expansion and Achievements
As the guild's missions became more successful, they opened numerous gateways to new worlds, each adding to the cultural tapestry of Sen. Each successful mission was commemorated with a new star added to the guild's celestial map, displayed prominently in the Astral Spire, their headquarters. The guild maintained a comprehensive archive of adventure logs, artifacts, and maps, which remain a valuable resource for scholars and explorers.

> "The Plasmoids of Plibt are unlike any beings we've encountered. Their fluid forms and unique perspectives on existence challenge our understanding of life itself. When we first approached them, our initial attempts at verbal communication were met with a single, repeated sound: 'Plibt.' It seems to be their only auditory response, as they prefer telepathic communication. Thus, we have named their world Plibt."
