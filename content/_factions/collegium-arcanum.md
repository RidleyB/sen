## History
### Founding and Early Years
The Collegium Arcanum was established centuries ago by a coalition of powerful mages who sought to create a centralized institution for the study and advancement of magic. The founding members recognized the need for a structured approach to magical education and research, one that would ensure the safe and ethical use of arcane power. Over time, the Collegium grew in both size and reputation, attracting some of the most brilliant magical minds from across the realm.

### Development and Growth
Throughout its history, the Collegium has expanded its reach and influence. It now oversees a network of colleges, academies, and institutes within Sen, each dedicated to a specific branch of magical study. This includes the accreditation of magical curricula, the certification of instructors, and the evaluation of research endeavors. The Collegium has also established rigorous standards of instruction and ethical conduct, ensuring that all who practice magic within Sen do so responsibly.

### Modern Era
In recent times, the Collegium has continued to play a pivotal role in Sen's magical and academic spheres. It remains at the forefront of arcane research, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with magic. However, the Collegium has also faced challenges, including internal divisions and external pressures. Despite these difficulties, it remains a respected authority on all matters magical and continues to contribute to the city's prosperity and security.

## Politics
### Influence and Alliances
The Collegium Arcanum wields considerable influence within Sen's political landscape. Its members are often called upon to provide expertise and counsel on matters pertaining to magical governance, security, and infrastructure. The Collegium is closely allied with the Montaigne family, a powerful aristocratic house known for its patronage of the magical arts. This alliance has proven mutually beneficial, allowing both parties to further their respective interests and maintain their positions of power.

### Role in Regulation
One of the Collegium's primary responsibilities is regulating the trade and transit of magical materials, artifacts, and components within Sen. This involves setting standards for the safe and ethical use of these items, as well as overseeing their distribution. The Collegium collaborates closely with the city's aristocracy and other factions, such as the Order of the Sacred Eye, to ensure that magical resources are used appropriately and do not fall into the wrong hands.

### Internal Struggles
The Collegium is not without controversy. Recently, a rift has emerged within the institution regarding the regulation of magical and scientific materials and study. Some members support strict safeguards to prevent the misuse of these resources, arguing that such measures are necessary to protect the city and its inhabitants. Others, however, contend that these regulations stifle innovation and academic freedom, hindering the advancement of magical knowledge. The challenge lies in finding a balance between ensuring security and promoting scholarly endeavors.

## Contributions to Sen
### Magical Law
The Collegium Arcanum, in conjunction with the city's governing bodies, enforces strict regulations on magical practices within Sen. One of the most notable restrictions pertains to warlock pacts, wherein individuals seek power from celestial or other powerful entities. Such pacts are viewed with suspicion and concern, as they have the potential to upset the natural balance of the city and pose a threat to its inhabitants. As a result, any individuals found entering into such pacts or practicing illegal forms of magic are subject to prosecution under the city's magical laws.
