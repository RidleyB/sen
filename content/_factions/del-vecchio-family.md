## History
The Del Vecchio family's history is a tale of redemption and transformation. The family's prominence was at its peak under Ettore, who built their vast commercial empire through both legitimate business ventures and criminal activity. Ettore's exploits eventually became a source of shame and scandal for the family, casting a long shadow over their reputation in Sen. His operations, though shrouded in secrecy, were characterized by corruption and deceit, amassing wealth and influence at the cost of the family's integrity.

As Alessandro and Marco matured, they grew increasingly troubled by their father's illicit dealings. Determined to cleanse their family's name and rid Sen of their father's corrupt influence, they embarked on a dangerous mission to expose their father's criminal activities. Gathering evidence and carefully planning their move, they ultimately brought their findings to the governors of the area and the [Paladin Order](../factions/order-of-the-open-hand), ensuring Ettore faced justice. This daring confrontation led to Ettore's incarceration and the dismantling of his criminal empire, sending shockwaves through Sen's political landscape.

In the aftermath of their father's downfall, Alessandro and Marco emerged as unlikely heroes. Their courage and integrity in confronting their father's crimes earned them newfound respect and admiration. Alessandro assumed the mantle of family leadership, dedicating himself to erasing the dark mark of their past. He became a vocal advocate for transparency and accountability, striving to reform Sen's political and economic systems from within.
