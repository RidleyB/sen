The Reinhardt family traces its lineage back through generations of valiant warriors, esteemed commanders, and steadfast defenders of Sen's borders. Founded upon the principles of duty, and honor, the Reinhardts have long been renowned for their unwavering commitment to protecting the realm through the Order of the Open Hand and upholding their traditions. 

Fiercely loyal to their own, the Reinhardts are known for their unwavering dedication to family, honor, and tradition. Bound by oaths of fealty and codes of conduct, they uphold a strict sense of duty and responsibility, often placing the needs of the family above all else. Despite their martial heritage and formidable reputation, the Reinhardts are not without their flaws, prone to bouts of pride, stubbornness, and recklessness when their honor is called into question.

# History

Twelve years ago, Friedrich's first wife Helene passed away due to illness. With little prospect for his eldest son to marry, Friedrich made the decision to remarry and procure a new heir. After marrying into a lesser house not long after his first wife's funeral, Nina, his second wife, soon became pregnant. With a new half brother, Karl was beset with an array of emotions surrounding his new family. Over the past five years, he has steeled himself into a cold and unyielding presence, likely due to his father's abandonment of his future prospects.

The Reinhardts have long been active members of the Paladins of Sen. Their active enlistment into their ranks throughout the city's history cements the family's devotion to Sen and the protection of its citizens. The Reinhardts are credited with multiple Paladins Supreme appointments throughout history, each fostering times of stability and peace throughout the city. Albrecht himself achieved the rank of Sentinel among their ranks, before retiring early due to a nearly mortal injury. 

In addition to martial prowess, the Reinhardts are known for their mastery of engineering and architecture, a legacy born from their early days into city development and infrastructure. Centuries ago, the Reinhardt family played a pivotal role in the construction of prominent civic buildings, a testament to their ingenuity and craftsmanship. Their expertise in building design, fortification, and urban planning has left an indelible mark on Sen's landscape, with structures crafted by Reinhardt artisans standing as enduring symbols of strength, beauty, and innovation.

The Reinhardt's recent political history is intertwined with that of the Santinis, marked by a failed marriage that ended in tragedy and betrayal. Over a decade ago, Karl Reinhardt, prospective scion of the Reinhardt house, was betrothed to Francesca Santini, Viola Santini's eldest daughter. The union was intended to cement a lasting alliance between the two noble houses and solidify the Reinhardts as a key player in the aristocratic world, but personal grievances and simmering tensions ultimately led to the dissolution of the engagement, leaving behind a legacy of bitterness and resentment that still lingers to this day. While the bitterness between the two families has faded over time, scars remain in both families. As for Karl and Francesca, the two remain unwed to the present day.

Present day, the Reinhardt family still shares a complex relationship with the Santinis; both competing for dominance and influence in the realm, the Reinhardts have become the primary competitors of the Santinis when it comes to matters of policing and enforcement of the boroughs, oftentimes enforcing different laws or ordinances and confusing the city folk. Despite their differences, the Reinhardts remain ever vigilant, ready to defend their honor and protect their interests at any cost.
