## Family Tree
Friedrich Reinhardt, the head of the family, had two sons with two different women; his first wife, Helene, gave birth to Karl. After Helene's death, Friedrich remarried Nina, with whom he had his second son, Phineas. Friedrich's brother, Albrecht Reinhardt, is married to Camille, and together they have a son, Fritz, who is betrothed to Lena Del Vecchio.

Twelve years ago, Friedrich's first wife, Helene, passed away due to illness. With little prospect for his eldest son to marry, Friedrich decided to remarry, and shortly after Helene's funeral, he married Nina. Nina soon became pregnant with Phineas, and Karl, beset by emotions surrounding his new family, became a cold and unyielding presence over the years, likely due to his father's perceived abandonment of his future prospects.

### Albrecht's Family

## History
The Reinhardt family traces its lineage back through generations of valiant warriors, esteemed commanders, and steadfast defenders of Sen's borders. Founded on principles of duty and honor, the Reinhardts have long been known for their unwavering commitment to protecting the realm and upholding their traditions. Their fierce loyalty to family and their code of conduct have made them a respected and influential family within Sen. However, this commitment to honor and tradition has also led to bouts of pride, stubbornness, and recklessness when their honor is called into question.

The Reinhardt family's longstanding rivalry with the Santinis has fueled tensions in Sen, especially following the failed marriage between Karl and Francesca Santini. The union was intended to cement an alliance between the two noble houses but ultimately ended in tragedy and betrayal, leaving behind a legacy of bitterness and resentment that still lingers. Despite this, the Reinhardts remain active members of the Paladins of Sen, with many members achieving high ranks and contributing to the city's stability and peace.

In addition to their martial prowess, the Reinhardts are known for their mastery of engineering and architecture. Centuries ago, they played a pivotal role in the construction of prominent civic buildings in Sen, leaving a lasting mark on the city's landscape. Their expertise in building design, fortification, and urban planning has cemented their reputation as master craftsmen and innovators. Despite their rivalry with the Santinis, the Reinhardts continue to uphold their traditions and remain vigilant in defending their honor and protecting their interests.

## Politics
The Reinhardt family is driven by a code of martial honor and duty, prioritizing loyalty, discipline, and protection of the realm. Their history of service in the Order of the Open Hand and contributions to Sen's defense highlight their commitment to these values. The Reinhardts believe in a structured, duty-bound society where honor and responsibility guide actions, ensuring the city's safety and integrity.
