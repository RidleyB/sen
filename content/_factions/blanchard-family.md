## History

### Origins and Cultural Roots
The Blanchard family's origins trace back several hundred years. Initially a small but influential family of Half-elves, their lineage quickly became a tapestry of mixed heritages, blending with pureblood humans, elves, and other Half-elves. This constant mingling of bloodlines made the Blanchards a unique reflection of Sen itself- a city of diversity, culture, and evolution.

Over generations, the family embraced the varied traditions of both their human and elven ancestors. From the Elves, they inherited a deep appreciation for beauty, craftsmanship, and the ethereal quality of art. The humans in their lineage brought innovation, ambition, and a desire to shape the future. This cultural blending allowed the Blanchards to establish themselves as visionaries in Sen's thriving artistic scene.

### The Rise of the Blanchards in Sen
As Sen continued to grow, so did the influence of the Blanchards. Recognizing the city's potential as a cultural center, the family devoted themselves to the enrichment of its artistic landscape. They became patrons of theatres, galleries, and performance venues, offering both financial support and creative guidance. Their involvement in the arts was not purely commercial-it was rooted in a genuine belief that art, in all its forms, had the power to inspire, educate, and elevate society.

The Blanchards' investments in public service also extended beyond the cultural sphere. They funded schools, sponsored scholarships, and supported initiatives that promoted education and intellectual growth. Their advocacy for the arts became intertwined with their broader philosophy of societal improvement, as they believed that access to culture and knowledge would lead to a more enlightened and progressive Sen.

### Cultural Dominance and Intellectual Pursuits
Throughout their history, the Blanchards have maintained a balance between their cultural roots and their modern aspirations. While they are deeply connected to the traditions of their mixed heritage, they are also committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible. This duality is most evident in their advocacy of liberal enlightenment principles-values that have come to define their family ethos.

The Blanchards are champions of progress, education, and reform. They believe that society can only thrive when its citizens are empowered with knowledge and the ability to think critically.

Their commitment to public service is not merely symbolic. The Blanchards regularly donate large sums to community projects, sponsoring the construction of public art installations, funding theatre productions, and ensuring that education in the arts remains accessible to all citizens. This devotion to philanthropy has earned them the admiration of the people of Sen, even as it occasionally draws the ire of more conservative aristocrats who view their support for reform with skepticism.
