In addition to their prowess in politics, the Montaignes have established themselves as advocates for scholarly pursuits, particularly within the esteemed halls of the Collegium Arcanum. Through their longstanding patronage and involvement with the Collegium, the Montaigne family has played a pivotal role in advancing magical knowledge, scientific innovation, and academic excellence in Sen. Their dedication to fostering a culture of learning and enlightenment has not only enriched the city's intellectual landscape but has also contributed to its reputation as a center of magical scholarship and discovery.

## Family Tree
Henri Montaigne's marriage to Giulia Santini, a union that brought together two influential families, further solidified the Montaignes' position within Sen's elite. Giulia's untimely passing was a significant loss, but her legacy endures through their daughter, Amelie, who is poised to carry forward the family's traditions of scholarship and civic duty.

## History
In recent years, the Henri Montaigne played a role in advocating for reform in the regulation of magical materials within the city. Historically, The Order had implemented stringent safeguards and restrictions on the production, import, and distribution of magical materials, citing concerns over their potential misuse and the need to maintain public safety. 

The Montaignes argued that overly restrictive regulations stifled the potential benefits of magical innovation and hindered the city's competitiveness in the magical marketplace. They emphasized the importance of striking a balance between ensuring public safety and encouraging the responsible use of magical materials for scientific advancement and economic prosperity. As part of their reform efforts, the Montaignes spearheaded initiatives to streamline bureaucratic processes, reduce red tape, and introduce incentives for magical researchers and entrepreneurs. 

## Politics
The Montaigne family stands for conservative stability, valuing tradition, order, and continuity. With a deep respect for Sen's historical foundations, they seek to preserve the city's established structures and uphold the status quo. Their intervention in the Santini-Reinhardt feud demonstrates their commitment to maintaining peace and stability within Sen's political framework.
