# History

The Montaignes have a significant presence within the Collegium Arcanum, the esteemed institute of magic and scholarly pursuit in Sen. They actively collaborate with scholars, mages, and researchers within the Collegium on various political matters including the flow of magical materials throughout Sen. Despite their influence within the Collegium, the Montaignes adhere to a strict family policy of avoiding nepotism; while many members of the family may hold positions of authority or influence within the Collegium, their appointments are supposedly based on merit and qualifications rather than familial connections. This commitment to meritocracy ensures that the Montaignes maintain a reputation for integrity and fairness in their dealings with the Collegium and the wider community.

In recent decades, the Montaigne family has played a significant role in advocating for reform in the regulation of magical materials within the city of Sen. Historically, The Order of the Open Hand had implemented stringent safeguards and restrictions on the production, import, and distribution of magical materials, citing concerns over their potential misuse and the need to maintain public safety. They argued that overly restrictive regulations stifled the potential benefits of magical innovation and hindered the city's competitiveness in the magical marketplace. They emphasized the importance of striking a balance between ensuring public safety and encouraging the responsible use of magical materials for scientific advancement and economic prosperity. As part of their reform efforts, the Montaignes spearheaded initiatives to streamline bureaucratic processes, reduce red tape, and introduce incentives for magical researchers and entrepreneurs. 

## Politics

### Moderation
The Montaignes advocate for moderation in politics, believing that compromise and consensus-building are essential for maintaining stability and harmony within society. They often seek to bridge divides between conflicting factions and promote policies that accommodate a wide range of perspectives.

### Meritocracy
Valuing intellect and expertise, the Montaignes support governance structures that prioritize meritocracy and the input of qualified individuals, regardless of their social status or background. They believe in the power of education and knowledge to drive progress and innovation in governance.

### Mediation
With a long tradition of diplomatic prowess, the Montaignes emphasize the importance of diplomacy and mediation in resolving conflicts. They champion dialogue and negotiation as effective tools for achieving peace and cooperation among rival factions.

### Liberalism
Minds open to all ideas open the way for more aggressive reform tactics within the political sphere- the Montaignes believe that sometimes rapid change can benefit the people of Sen.
