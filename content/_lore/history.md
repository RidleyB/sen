The Celestial City of Sen, an ancient and mystical realm, is believed to have been created by the god Anzu. According to legend, Anzu sought to establish a sanctuary where mortal races could find refuge, opportunity, and community. This divine vision manifested as Sen, a large, circular city floating amidst the cosmic tapestry.

## History

### Discovery and Early Settlement

Sen was first discovered by the Tayir, an Owlin race hailing from the world of Qon. Their exploration led them to this celestial sanctuary, where they quickly recognized the city's potential as a melting pot of cultures, races, and ideas. The Tayir's discovery marked the beginning of Sen's rich history of inclusivity and diversity.

In reverence to Anzu and the other ancient gods of the Tayir, the inhabitants of Sen established the Church of the Union. This religious order was dedicated to preserving the teachings of these deities and safeguarding the city's prosperity. The Church's enforcers, known as the Lord's Hands, were entrusted with maintaining the sanctity of Sen's interdimensional gateways and upholding the principles of compassion, justice, and unity. To this day, the Lord's Hands play a crucial role in the city's governance and spiritual life.

As threats to Sen's safety emerged, a cadre of noble warriors known as the Order of the Open Hand arose to defend the city. These warriors, clad in gleaming armor and wielding weapons infused with divine power, pledged their lives to the protection of Sen and its inhabitants. Their vigilance ensured the security of the city's gateways and the safety of its citizens.

## Eras

### The Era of the Dawn
The Era of the Dawn marks the inception of Sen, the Celestial City, and the dawn of recorded history within its shimmering walls. It is a period shrouded in myth and legend, with the origins of the city intertwined with the divine vision of Anzu, the Bridge Between Worlds, and the ancient gods of the Tayir. According to myth and oral tradition passed down through the ages, Anzu, seeking to create a sanctuary for mortal races amidst the cosmic tapestry, crafted Sen as a beacon of hope, unity, and opportunity. With its circular layout and interdimensional gateways, Sen emerged as a nexus point where diverse cultures, races, and ideas converged.

### The Era of Discovery

The second era of Sen's history, known as the Era of Discovery, was a time of unprecedented growth and exploration. With the interdimensional gateways firmly established, Sen became a hub of magical and scientific research. Scholars, inventors, and alchemists from across countless worlds flocked to the city, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and unlocking new technologies that revolutionized life within Sen.

### The Shimmering Era

The Shimmering Era is often regarded as the pinnacle of Sen's cultural and intellectual achievements. The establishment of the Collegium Arcanum and the proliferation of arts and sciences defined this period. The city's population grew, and new districts were developed, reflecting the diverse and cosmopolitan nature of Sen. New government bodies emerged as the city grew, forming the beginnings of the aristocratic boroughs we see today.

### The Era of Strife

Following a golden era in the city's history, the Era of Strife was marked by significant upheaval, political conflicts, and external threats. The Order of the Sacred Eye emerged during this era, tasked with maintaining order and rooting out corruption that had infiltrated the city. Aggressive lobbying against centralized governments and a push for independence from the Church were key elements of this tumultuous period.

In response, the Church of the Union established an inquisitorial branch known as the Order of the Sacred Eye. These dedicated agents worked tirelessly to root out sources of contagion, dangerous materials, and malevolent entities, preserving the city's prosperity and security. While the Order of the Open Hand protected Sen externally, the Sacred Eye ensured its internal safety." %}

{% include tab-content.html titleLevel=3 title="A Beacon of Progress" content="Despite these challenges, Sen flourished, emerging as a beacon of progress, innovation, and enlightenment. Its streets bustled with activity, traders haggled over exotic goods from distant realms, scholars debated the nature of the cosmos in universities, and artisans crafted wondrous inventions. The Paladins of Sen maintained their vigilant watch over the city's borders, while the Inquisitors kept a keen eye within them. As this era drew to a close, Sen stood as a testament to the ingenuity, resilience, and unity of its people." %}

### The Modern Era

In the modern era, Sen's population has swelled to unprecedented numbers, fueling a surge in commerce, culture, and innovation. However, amidst the bustling crowds and towering edifices, whispers of unrest and uncertainty linger. Larger governmental bodies have given way to smaller, aristocratic factions, leading to a reduction in the influence of the Order of the Open Hand. Private parties with private interests now patrol some areas of the city, and rumors of illicit affairs and corruption spread like wildfire.

{% include tab-content.html titleLevel=3 title="Internal Strife" content="Within the Order of the Open Hand, once a bastion of unity and purpose, division and discord threaten to undermine the organization's mission. Factions have emerged, each advocating for a different vision of Sen's future and the role of the order within it. Some members argue for a return to the traditional values of compassion and cooperation espoused by Anzu, while others advocate for a more aggressive stance against external threats and internal dissent. As tensions rise, the unity that once defined the order hangs precariously in the balance." %}

## The Future of Sen

Despite the challenges and uncertainties that loom on the horizon, Sen stands poised at the threshold of a new age. The city's leaders and inhabitants recognize the need to confront the pressing issues of the present while charting a path towards a brighter future. As Sen navigates the complexities of a changing world, its resilience and determination will be put to the test, shaping the course of history for generations to come.

Sen's legacy, rooted in the divine vision of Anzu, continues to inspire its people to strive for a harmonious and prosperous future, making the Celestial City of Sen a timeless beacon of hope and unity.
