Beyond the inner rings, the city sprawls into the outer rings, which are less rigid in their structure and more expansive. These areas are divided into various boroughs, each with its own distinct character and community. The outer rings are the lifeblood of Sen, where the majority of its inhabitants live, work, and engage in trade. Markets, residential areas, and commercial districts interweave to create a vibrant and thriving urban tapestry.

The outer rings are constantly evolving, as the magical outer walls of Sen expand to accommodate the growing population and new arrivals from different worlds. This fluidity allows the city to adapt and integrate new cultures and innovations seamlessly. The diverse neighborhoods, each with their unique charm and specialties, contribute to the rich cultural mosaic that defines Sen.
