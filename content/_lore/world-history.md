The Celestial City of Sen, an ancient and mystical realm, is believed to have been created by the god Anzu. According to legend, Anzu sought to establish a sanctuary where mortal races could find refuge, opportunity, and community. This divine vision manifested as Sen, a large, circular city floating amidst the cosmic tapestry.

## Discovery and Early Settlement
Sen was first discovered by the Tayir, an Owlin race hailing from the world of Qon. Their exploration led them to this celestial sanctuary, where they quickly recognized the city's potential as a melting pot of cultures, races, and ideas. The Tayir's discovery marked the beginning of Sen's rich history of inclusivity and diversity.

In reverence to Anzu and the other ancient gods of the Tayir, the inhabitants of Sen established the Church of the Union. This religious order was dedicated to preserving the teachings of these deities and safeguarding the city's prosperity. The Church's enforcers, known as the Lord's Hands, were entrusted with maintaining the sanctity of Sen's interdimensional gateways and upholding the principles of compassion, justice, and unity. To this day, the Lord's Hands play a crucial role in the city's governance and spiritual life.

As threats to Sen's safety emerged, a cadre of noble warriors known as the Order of the Open Hand arose to defend the city. These warriors, clad in gleaming armor and wielding weapons infused with divine power, pledged their lives to the protection of Sen and its inhabitants. Their vigilance ensured the security of the city's gateways and the safety of its citizens.

# The Era of Discovery
In the second era of Sen's history, the city experienced unprecedented growth and discovery. With the interdimensional gateways firmly established, Sen became a hub of magical and scientific research. Scholars, inventors, and alchemists from across countless worlds flocked to the city, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and unlocking new technologies that revolutionized life within Sen.

## The Order of the Sacred Eye
As Sen expanded, it faced new challenges, including diseases, magical maladies, and alien creatures. In response, the Church of the Union established an inquisitorial branch known as the Order of the Sacred Eye. These dedicated agents worked tirelessly to root out sources of contagion, dangerous materials, and malevolent entities, preserving the city's prosperity and security. While the Order of the Open Hand protected Sen externally, the Sacred Eye ensured its internal safety.

## A Beacon of Progress
Despite these challenges, Sen flourished, emerging as a beacon of progress, innovation, and enlightenment. Its streets bustled with activity, traders haggled over exotic goods from distant realms, scholars debated the nature of the cosmos in universities, and artisans crafted wondrous inventions. The Paladins of Sen maintained their vigilant watch over the city's borders, while the Inquisitors kept a keen eye within them. As this era drew to a close, Sen stood as a testament to the ingenuity, resilience, and unity of its people.

# The Modern Era
In the modern era, Sen's population has swelled to unprecedented numbers, fueling a surge in commerce, culture, and innovation. However, amidst the bustling crowds and towering edifices, whispers of unrest and uncertainty linger. Larger governmental bodies have given way to smaller, aristocratic factions, leading to a reduction in the influence of the Order of the Open Hand. Private parties with private interests now patrol some areas of the city, and rumors of illicit affairs and corruption spread like wildfire.

## Internal Strife
Within the Order of the Open Hand, once a bastion of unity and purpose, division and discord threaten to undermine the organization's mission. Factions have emerged, each advocating for a different vision of Sen's future and the role of the order within it. Some members argue for a return to the traditional values of compassion and cooperation espoused by Anzu, while others advocate for a more aggressive stance against external threats and internal dissent. As tensions rise, the unity that once defined the order hangs precariously in the balance.

# The Future of Sen
Despite the challenges and uncertainties that loom on the horizon, Sen stands poised at the threshold of a new age. The city's leaders and inhabitants recognize the need to confront the pressing issues of the present while charting a path towards a brighter future. As Sen navigates the complexities of a changing world, its resilience and determination will be put to the test, shaping the course of history for generations to come.

Sen's legacy, rooted in the divine vision of Anzu, continues to inspire its people to strive for a harmonious and prosperous future, making the Celestial City of Sen a timeless beacon of hope and unity.

# The Era of the Dawn

In the earliest days of Sen, the celestial city stood as a testament to the vision of Anzu. A benevolent and powerful god, Anzu created Sen as a sanctuary where beings from across the cosmos could find refuge, opportunity, and community. The city's walls were erected at the intersection of interdimensional gateways, opening pathways to virtually limitless worlds. As Anzu opened these gateways, Sen became a beacon of diversity, welcoming people of all races, cultures, and walks of life.

With the inclusion of the interdimensional gateways, Sen's population began to swell as travelers from distant realms arrived to seek refuge or pursue adventure. The gateways facilitated trade, cultural exchange, and the sharing of knowledge, fostering a rich tapestry of diversity within the city. As different cultures mingled within Sen's walls, a vibrant society emerged, blending traditions, languages, and customs from across the cosmos. Markets teemed with exotic goods, temples echoed with prayers in thanks to Anzu, and academies buzzed with scholarly debates spanning the realms and sharing their research.

Anzu's teachings of compassion, cooperation, and respect for diversity became the bedrock of Sen's ethos. The inhabitants of the city revered their celestial benefactor, honoring his memory through rituals, festivals, and acts of kindness. His legacy endured through the ages, shaping the destiny of Sen and its people. In reverence to Him, the people of Sen established the Church of the Union, a religious order dedicated to preserving Anzu's teachings and safeguarding the city's prosperity. The members of the order, known as the Lord's Hands, were tasked with maintaining the sanctity of Sen's interdimensional gateways and upholding the principles of compassion, justice, and unity. They operate to this day in the city.

As threats to the city's safety emerged, a cadre of noble warriors arose to defend Sen from harm. Those warriors took open hand to sword, and pledged their lives to the protection of the city and its inhabitants. Clad in gleaming armor and wielding weapons infused with divine power, the Order of the Open Hand safeguarded the city's gateways, ensuring the protection of the city's citizens.

The Era of the Dawn left an indelible mark on the city and its inhabitants, shaping its identity as a bastion of diversity, innovation, and cooperation. Anzu's legacy has endured through the ages, guiding the city's leaders and inspiring its people to embrace the values of unity, compassion, and cultural exchange. As Sen entered subsequent eras of prosperity and challenge, the lessons of its founding remained a source of strength and resilience for generations to come.

# The Era of Discovery

In the second era of Sen's history, the city experienced a period of unprecedented growth and discovery. With the gateways firmly established and opening to more and more worlds, Sen maintained it's status as a hub of magical and scientific research, attracting scholars, inventors, and alchemists from across countless worlds. These visionaries pushed the boundaries of knowledge, unraveling the mysteries of the universe and unlocking new technologies that revolutionized life within the city.

As Sen expanded, it faced new challenges and threats that tested the resilience of its inhabitants. Diseases, and magical maladies, and alien creatures began making their way into the city, threatening the health and well-being of its citizens. In response, the Order of the Open Hand established an inquisitorial branch known as the Order of the Sacred Eye; to root out sources of contagion, dangerous materials, and malevolent entities. These dedicated agents worked tirelessly to safeguard Sen from internal and external threats, preserving the city's prosperity and security. If the Lord's Hand and the Paladin order were the left and right hand for the city, the Inquisitors acted as their eyes.

Despite the challenges, Sen flourished during this era, emerging as a beacon of progress, innovation, and enlightenment. Its streets bustled with activity as traders haggled over exotic goods from distant realms, scholars debated the nature of the cosmos in universities, and artisans crafted wondrous inventions that captivated the imagination. The Paladins of Sen maintained their vigil of the city's borders, and the Inquisitors kept a keen eye inside them. As the era drew to a close, Sen stood as a testament to the ingenuity, resilience, and unity of its people, poised to face whatever challenges the future might bring.

# The Modern Era

In the modern era of Sen's history, the city's population has begun to swell to unprecedented numbers, fueling a surge in commerce, culture, and innovation. However, amidst the bustling crowds and towering edifices, whispers of unrest and uncertainty linger, as scholars warn of the logistical challenges posed by Sen's size and complexity. Larger governmental bodies have been replaced by smaller ones, creating pockets of aristocratic control over the entire city. As a result, the reach of Order of the Open Hand has begun to shrink in some of these circles- the streets patrolled instead by private parties with private interest. While there are no telltale signs of widespread corruption, rumors of illicit affairs and back-alley deals spread like wildfire. 

Within the hallowed halls of the Order of the Open Hand, once a bastion of unity and purpose, division and discord threaten to undermine the organization's mission. Factions emerge within the ranks of the Lord's Hands, each advocating for a different vision of Sen's future and the role of the order within it. Some members argue for a return to the traditional values of compassion and cooperation espoused by Anzu, while others advocate for a more aggressive stance in the face of external threats and internal dissent. As tensions rise and tempers flare, the unity that once defined the order hangs precariously in the balance.

Despite the challenges and uncertainties that loom on the horizon, Sen stands poised at the threshold of a new age, its destiny yet to be written. While there have been no significant events or upheavals to mark the beginning of this era, the city's leaders and inhabitants alike recognize the need to confront the pressing issues of the present while charting a path towards a brighter future. As Sen navigates the complexities of a changing world, its resilience and determination will be put to the test, shaping the course of history for generations to come.
