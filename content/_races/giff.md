The Giff, hailing from the militaristic world of Vordara, are known for their discipline and combat prowess. They arrived in Sen as refugees, their home-world left in ruins by the murderous Thri-kreen. Today, they are continuing to slowly rebuild their homeland. Giff often served as mercenaries and bodyguards in Sen to make ends meet, and have over time become an integral part of the city's security forces.
