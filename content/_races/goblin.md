**Description:** Goblins originate from the vibrant world of Verdyth. Initially perceived as hostile due to their aggressive tendencies, they came to Sen seeking new opportunities and have since thrived in its bustling marketplaces and underbelly. Many of the other goblinoid races of Verdyth have been banned from Sen because of their uncontrollable aggression. In Sen, Goblins are known for their resourcefulness, quick thinking, and ability to adapt, often working as traders, craftsmen, and adventurers.
