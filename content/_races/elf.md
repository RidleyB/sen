**Description:** Elves originate from the mystical forests of Verdyth, a region rich in magic and natural beauty. They are known for their longevity, grace, and deep connection to the arcane. The elves have a strong sense of duty to protect their ancient heritage and lands. They came to Sen to share their vast knowledge, uphold their traditions, and find common ground with other races. In Sen, elves are respected as wise scholars, formidable wizards, and noble guardians of culture and magic.
