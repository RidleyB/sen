**Description:** The Bullywug originate from the lush, tropical world of Zaratal, where they dwell in dense swamps and vibrant wetlands. Known for their strong community bonds, the Bullywug are adept at navigating their watery environments and living in harmony with the ecosystem. They came to Sen driven by curiosity and the promise of new opportunities, seeking to explore beyond their swampy homes and integrate into the city's diverse society. They are rare in Sen, many having returned to the comfort of home after seeing the stark change from their home.
