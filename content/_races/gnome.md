**Home-World:** {{ page.world | capitalize }}

**Description:** Gnomes come from the dense jungles of Verdyth. They are known for their ingenuity, curiosity, and resilience, often pushing the boundaries of what is possible. They have long feuded with the Goblinoid races of Verdyth alongside the Elves, and struggle to reconcile their history of conflict with the global culture in Sen, striving to overcome lingering prejudices and forge new alliances.
