The Hadozee, from the oceanic and seafaring world of Saphor, are skilled sailors and navigators. They arrived in Sen during the Era of Discovery, bringing their knowledge of trade and commerce to the city. Hadozee are rarely found in the city, although they hold a small minority in the Guild of Open Commerce.
