Contructs are one of the newest additions to Sen, and arguably the first nativ races to the city. Created in the later years of the era of discovery, they are constructs brought to life through a blend of magic and technology, seeking purpose and identity in a world of flesh and blood. They were created by a gifted wizard The Contructs gaining sentience was a surprising addition to their creation, to which the Contructs attribute to a god of their own creation, Automachus.

## Arcanus Volturis
Arcanus Volturis Peverell was a legendary archmage whose curiosity about the boundaries between life and artificial constructs led him to unlock the secrets of creating sentient beings. He was a visionary, obsessed with the idea of merging arcane magic and intricate engineering to create life where there was none.

### Origins and Early Work

Volturis hailed from a prestigious lineage of mages known for their contributions to both magical theory and practical enchantments. His early experiments involved animating simple constructs to perform tasks, which later evolved into more complex creations.

### Discovery and Experimentation

Volturis's breakthrough came when he stumbled upon ancient texts hinting at a primordial force capable of bestowing life and intellect. Intrigued, he devoted his life to deciphering these texts and conducting experiments that blended magic with advanced mechanical craftsmanship.

### The First Contructs:

In a monumental experiment, Volturis created the first Contructs, a construct far more sophisticated than any before. However, it is believe that the divine spark of Automachus that truly awakened the creation. This Contructs, named Primus, became the prototype for all subsequent models.

### Legacy and Influence:

Volturis's work did not end with the creation of the first Contructs. He established the Fabricum Arcanum Forge, a sanctuary where like-minded mages and engineers could continue to refine the process. His teachings emphasized not only the technical aspects but also the ethical implications of creating sentient beings and their agency.
