# The Cataclysm
---

The ancient homeworld of the humans, known in legend as Drakoria, was a place of unparalleled beauty and prosperity. It was a world of majestic landscapes, from towering mountains and verdant forests to sprawling cities brimming with knowledge and culture. However, a great cataclysm, the nature of which is shrouded in myth, led to the planet's inevitable destruction. Facing annihilation, the wisest and most resourceful among humanity devised a desperate plan to save their species. In a last-ditch effort, they constructed a fleet of massive, ark-like vessels capable of traversing the cosmos. These ships were launched into the unknown, carrying humanity's remnants to the stars.

## Idealized Drakoria
Drakoria is remembered through the lens of nostalgia and reverence, with some details exaggerated by the passage of centuries, and others forgotten outright. Stories passed down through generations speak of a utopian world where harmony and prosperity reigned. It was said to be a place where the arts flourished, science and magic coexisted, and the people lived in unity under the benevolent gaze of the High One, their sole deity. The loss of Drakoria is an old wound that still runs deep, and its memory serves as a source of inspiration and longing for displaced humans scattered across the cosmos.

# The High One
---

The High One is an ancient deity whose memory has faded over the centuries, lost in the sands of time and the chaos of displacement. Once revered as the supreme creator and ruler of the original human world, the High One's identity has become intertwined with the myths and legends of the diverse worlds where humans found refuge after the destruction of their homeland. His true nature and domains of worship have been obscured by the passage of time and the blending of cultures, resulting in a fragmented and distorted understanding among his scattered followers.

In the varied and diverse worlds now inhabited by humans, the High One is remembered differently. In some places, he is seen as a god of creation and wisdom, a distant but benevolent figure watching over his scattered children. In others, he is a god of survival and resilience, symbolizing humanity's enduring spirit and adaptability in the face of overwhelming odds. The scattered human populations, despite their differences, share a common reverence for this ancient deity, whose legacy unites them in their shared history and hope for the future.

# Human Presence
---

As the arks from Drakoria journeyed through space, they crash-landed on various worlds, each becoming a new home for the human diaspora. As of the modern era, there are at least 12 separate worlds with a recorded human presence, either past or present. The most successful of which is Aerion.

## Advanced Tech
The ancient arks of Drakoria possessed the capability of space-travel, a technology currently unknown to the modern universe. Regrettably, this technology has been lost by time, the locations of any remnants of arks a complete mystery. If a discovery were to be made, the Humans may be able to learn more about their ancient homeland.
