**Description:** Deep Gnomes, or Svirfneblin, originate from the subterranean realms of Verdyth, specifically the mysterious Underdark. These gnomes are known for their exceptional mining skills, keen intellect, and mastery of illusion magic, which they use to navigate and survive the dangers of their underground world. Many came to Sen to seek riches on new worlds, others looking for an escape from the tumultuous relationship with the Drow and the Elves in the homeworld. In Sen, Deep Gnomes are valued for their expertise in mining, gem-cutting, and enchanting, contributing significantly to the city's wealth and knowledge.
