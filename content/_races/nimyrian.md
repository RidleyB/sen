**Description:** Nimyrians are the cursed descendants of an ancient kingdom on [TODO]. Centuries ago, a monarch swore their people's allegiance to the Celestial Nimyr, unaware of his true goals. When the pact was broken, Nimyr cursed them with a hellish appearance. Nimyrians came to Sen seeking acceptance and a chance to prove their worth despite their cursed lineage. In Sen, they are known for their resilience, determination, and the unique powers granted by their curse, striving to find a place where they can be judged by their deeds rather than their appearance.
