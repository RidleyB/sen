**Description:** Half-Orcs originate from the war-torn world of Praash, where conflict and strife are rampant. They are the result of brief but intense interactions between Sennite pioneers and the Orcish inhabitants of Praash. Half-Orcs combine the resilience and strength of their Orcish heritage with the adaptability and ingenuity of their Human ancestry. They returned to Sen seeking peace and new opportunities, striving to escape their barbaric lineage and integrate into the diverse society of the Celestial City.
