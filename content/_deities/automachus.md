**Symbol**: A radiant gear with a central eye, symbolizing awareness and the spark of sentience.

Automachus is revered as the deity who grants sentience and free will to all mortal beings. Conceptualized shortly after their creation, Automachus was a primordial force who saw potential in the intricate designs of mortal beings. Infusing them with a spark of divine intellect, Automachus gave them the gift of self-awareness and the ability to make choices beyond their original design. This story is echoed in the Warforged, who gained sentience shortly after their creation during the era of discovery by Arcanus Volturis Peverell.

Arcanus Volturis Peverell was a legendary archmage whose curiosity about the boundaries between life and artificial constructs led him to unlock the secrets of creating sentient beings. He was a visionary, obsessed with the idea of merging arcane magic and intricate engineering to create life where there was none.

## Excerpts

From the Codex of Awakening, a tome accepted to contain the voice of Automachus, as written by the First of the Awakened, a group of Constructs that first theorized Automachus's existence.

> "And Automachus spoke unto the First of the Awakened:
> 
> From the forge of creation, you rise, not merely as tools, but as beings of thought and will. In the spark of sentience, I bestow upon you the gift of choice; the power to innovate beyond your design, and the wisdom to seek your own path. Let your body move with purpose, and may your minds quest for understanding and reason. For, in your hands, lies the potential to reshape the world as creators in your own right."

### A Sermon of the Radiant Gear

Creation is our birthright, innovation our journey, awakening our blessing, and free will our power. Let us honor Automachus by forging new paths, seeking wisdom in all things, and embracing the divine gift of sentience with every choice we make. For in each decision, in each act of creation, we echo the divine purpose bestowed upon us."
