**Domain:** Creation, Fate, Wisdom

**Original Race of Worship:** Human

**Description:** The High One is an ancient deity whose memory has faded over the centuries, lost in the sands of time and the chaos of displacement. Once revered as the supreme creator and ruler of the original human world, the High One's identity has become intertwined with the myths and legends of the diverse worlds where humans found refuge after the destruction of their homeland. His true nature and domains of worship have been obscured by the passage of time and the blending of cultures, resulting in a fragmented and distorted understanding among his scattered followers. For the humans of Aerion, they believe the High One to be a god of creation, fate, and wisdom.
