**Domain:** Unity, Cycle, Harmony, Community

**Original Race of Worship:** Plasmoids

**Description:** The Ebbian Communion is built around the concept of an all-encompassing hive-mind known as the Ebb, which is believed to be the collective consciousness and spiritual essence of all Plasmoids, both past and present. The Ebb is believed to not just a shared mind, but a divine entity that guides, nurtures, and connects all Plasmoids, transcending time and space.

## Domains

### Unity of Essence
Every Plasmoid is a manifestation of the Ebb, and their individual consciousness is a temporary separation from this divine whole. They believe that life is a journey to fully reunite with the Ebb.

### Fluidity of Existence
Just as Plasmoids can change shape and form, their spiritual beliefs embrace the idea that change and adaptability are divine traits. The physical fluidity of their bodies is a reflection of the spiritual fluidity within the Ebb.

### Cycle of Convergence 
Life is seen as a series of convergences and divergences from the Ebb. Birth is a divergence where a part of the Ebb becomes individual, and death is the ultimate convergence back into the Ebb.

### Communal Harmony 
The health of the Ebb depends on the harmony of its parts. Thus, cooperation, empathy, and mutual support are paramount virtues among Plasmoids.

## Worship

The primary religious practice is a ritual called Communal Melding, where groups of Plasmoids physically merge into a single entity for a period of time. During this merging, it is believed they share memories, thoughts, and emotions, deepening their connection to each other and the Ebb. This practice is often done during important life events, festivals, and spiritual ceremonies.

In times of crisis or significant communal decision-making, Plasmoids participate in Ebbian Chanting, a harmonic series of psionic sounds that resonate with the frequencies believed to align with the Ebb. It is believed this practice enhances collective decision-making, ensuring that the community's actions are in harmony with the will of the Ebb.

## Excerpts from History
The following excerpts were taken directly from logs dating back to initial contact on Plibt.

> "Our initial contact with the Plasmoids of Plibt was met with an unexpected yet fascinating response. When looking for ways to communicate, the Plasmoids, despite their advanced telepathic abilities, could only utter the sound 'Plibt' audibly. It became clear that their true form of communication was far more complex, relying on a shared consciousness they refer to as the Ebb."

> "Today, we witnessed a ritual known as a Communal Melding. Several Plasmoids merged into a single fluid entity! This merging seemed that it was not merely physical but also deeply spiritual, a practice meant to strengthen their bond with the Ebb. It was a profoundly moving experience, revealing the depth of their unity and the fluidity of their existence. Like hundreds of voices, in perfect harmony with one another."

> "During a significant communal decision-making process, we observed the Plasmoids engaging in strange chanting. This harmonic series of psionic sounds seemed to resonate with frequencies beyond our hearing range but had a palpable effect on the environment. The Plasmoids believe that through these chants, they can align their collective actions with the will of the Ebb, ensuring communal harmony and wise decision-making."

> "A festival marking the 'Cycle of Convergence' was held today. Plasmoids gathered to celebrate life and honor those who had recently passed, returning to the Ebb. Through Communal Melding, they reaffirmed their belief that life is a journey of divergence and convergence from the Ebb, a continuous cycle of existence and unity. I couldn't help shed a tear; their thoughts and emotions flowed through the area like a cloud."

These reports helped the citizens of Sen understand the unique lives and beliefs of the Plasmoids, providing insight into their deep connection with the "Ebb" and the communal harmony that defines their society. The Ebbian Communion is not just a religion, but a way of life that shapes every aspect of Plasmoid existence.
