**Domain:** Weather, Travel, Change

**Original Race of Worship:** Hadozee

**Description:** Pelagia controls the winds that fill the sails of the Hadozee's ships. He is both a bringer of gentle breezes and fierce storms, symbolizing the ever-changing nature of the sea. His symbol is a spiraling gust of wind. Masts on ships are typically dedicated to Pelagia, and meticulously decorated with her likeness. Devouts of Pelagia claim to feel the push and pull of the wind's currents.
