Tsolkial is worshiped as the arbiter of balance in the world, governing the natural cycles and the deeper mysteries of the arcane. The Yuan-ti believe that true understanding and power come from embracing both sides of Tsolkial' dualityâ€”acknowledging that light cannot exist without dark, and creation is meaningless without destruction.

# Religious Practices and Rituals
The Yuan-ti practice a highly structured and ritualistic religion, with strict ceremonies and daily observances dedicated to Tsolkial. These rituals emphasize the pursuit of knowledge, the balance of opposing forces, and the mastery of magical arts.

## Sacred Rites

### Twilight Invocation
A daily ritual performed at dawn and dusk, representing the transition between light and dark. The Yuan-ti gather in sacred groves or temples, reciting prayers and mantras to Tsolkial, asking for balance and guidance. The dawn ritual focuses on invoking the aspect of creation and light, while the dusk ritual honors the aspect of destruction and darkness.

### Rite of Duality
A monthly ceremony held on the night of the new moon, where the Yuan-ti engage in meditative practices and complex rituals that symbolize the union of opposites. This rite often involves symbolic acts such as sexual acts, and performing transformative magic to demonstrate mastery over both aspects of Tsolkial.

### Cycle of Renewal
An annual festival celebrating the cyclical nature of life and death, creation and destruction. This festival includes feasts, storytelling, and elaborate performances that depict the legends of Tsolkial. The highlight of the festival is a grand ritual where offerings are made to Tsolkial, and participants engage in transformative magic to renew their connection to the deity and the balance it represents.

### Serpent's Meditation
A personal daily practice where individual Yuan-ti spend time in quiet contemplation, seeking to understand and internalize the dual aspects of Tsolkial. This meditation involves focusing on dual symbols and mantras, often in secluded, natural settings where they can feel close to the primal magic of Sssarvass.

## Temples and Sacred Sites
The Yuan-ti build their temples and sacred sites in secluded areas of the jungles and swamps, away from prying eyes. These places are designed to reflect the dual nature of Tsolkial, with one side often bathed in light and the other in shadow. Temples are adorned with intricate carvings and symbols representing the balance of opposing forces, and they serve as centers for learning, meditation, and magical practice.

## Religious Hierarchy
The Yuan-ti religious structure is led by a high priest or priestess, known as the Voice of Tsolkial, who is believed to be the direct conduit for the deity's will. Below them are various priests, scholars, and practitioners who oversee the different aspects of religious life, from conducting rituals to teaching the young.

This monotheistic religion shapes every aspect of Yuan-ti society, emphasizing the importance of balance, knowledge, and the mastery of magic. By venerating Tsolkial, the Yuan-ti strive to maintain harmony within their world and within themselves, navigating the complexities of existence with wisdom and reverence.
