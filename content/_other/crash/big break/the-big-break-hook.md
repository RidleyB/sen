As dawn breaks over the bustling city of Sen, you stand among your fellow Discovery Adventurers, ready to embark on your latest mission. This is no ordinary exploration; this is a "**Crash**" â€“ a high-stakes, rapid reconnaissance of a new and alien world.

The briefing was brief, the details scarce. What you know is this: you will be the first to set foot in this uncharted territory. Your mission is straightforward: survive, explore, and gather as much information as possible within 48 hours.

Led by your seasoned superior, Oliana Ajuera, you prepare to step through the shimmering portal, leaving the familiar behind. The thrill of the unknown pulses through you. This is what you trained for. This is why you joined the Guild of Discovery.

The portal hums with arcane energy, and with a final glance at your comrades, you step forward into the blinding light, ready to face whatever awaits on the other side.
