# The Story
<br>
**The Guild of Discovery:** a vanguard of explorers, scholars, and daring adventurers who push beyond the known to illuminate the dark corners of existence. Among their ranks, you stand as one of the few entrusted with the most dangerous assignments — the **Crash Teams**.

Today, you’ve drawn one of the most unusual missions in recent Guild history.

The world is called **Plibt**, named after the only sound its native inhabitants — the **Plasmoids** — made when first contacted. A recent research expedition to Plibt went dark 18 hours ago; no signals, no return party. The only thing that made it back was a single data spike, pulsing with indecipherable psychic residue... and a location marker.

**Your team has been chosen to investigate.**

Your mission is not to rescue — not exactly. The last team was well aware of the risks. Your orders are to retrieve their research, assess what went wrong, and extract yourselves before exposure sets in. You’ve been warned: prolonged contact with Plibt changes people. Sometimes permanently.

This is a world where thoughts echo, flesh bends, and identity is fluid. The line between self and other will blur. The line between explorer and specimen may blur too.


### **Your Objectives Are Clear:**

* **Recover** the data and biological samples from the missing research team.
* **Survive** exposure to Plibt's alien biosphere and psychic resonance.
* **Return** before your minds or bodies become part of the world itself.

The portal flares! You steel your nerves, and step forward.

Into Plibt. Into the unknown.

Before the unknown becomes *you*.
