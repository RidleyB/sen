The Celestial City; a sprawling magical metropolis known for its adaptive architecture and rich history. The city is divided into concentric rings, with each ring serving a distinct purpose and housing different factions and buildings of importance. The city's enchated walls can expand their footprint to accommodate growth and changing needs, resulting in a dynamic urban landscape. The outer rings are characterized by dense urban housing, while the inner rings feature older, more established buildings that are steeped in history and tradition.

The world of Sen has no countryside; no hills, mountains, or open plains. It is simply a city, situated at the center of the universe with no other land associated with it. The weather is temperate, with mild weather patterns. It rains and seldom storms, providing the streets with a much needed cleanse occasionally. It has an atmosphere, with fluffy white clouds and a crystal blue sky. The sun, aptly named Solara, tracks across the sky like it would a planetary body. Several moons orbit Sen as if they would a planet, and stars fill the night sky just as they would in a regular world. 

## Core

At the heart of Sen lies the Grand Cathedral of the Church of the Union. This structure is a constant reminder of the city's divine benefactor, Anzu, and the ancient pantheon of Qon. The Grand Cathedral is not only a place of worship but also a center for spiritual guidance and community gatherings. Its towering spires and intricate architecture dominate the skyline, making it visible from almost every part of the city. 

The Lord's Hands, the devouts of the Church of the Union, allow any and all into the grand cathedral, to worship, pay their respects. Those in need of assistance often beseech the help of the church, who lend a hand to those who are in need of it. 

## The Inner Rings
Surrounding the Grand Cathedral is the inner ring, home to many of Sen's most prominent public buildings. This area is characterized by its grandeur and importance, housing the headquarters of various guilds, judiciary buildings, and illustrious colleges. These institutions play a crucial role in the governance, education, and development of the city, fostering an environment where knowledge and justice prevail. The inner ring is a hub of activity, frequented by scholars, officials, and influential figures who contribute to the city's growth and governance.

## The Outer Rings
Beyond the inner rings, the city sprawls into the outer rings, which are less rigid in their structure and more expansive. These areas are divided into various boroughs, each with its own distinct character and community. The outer rings are the lifeblood of Sen, where the majority of its inhabitants live, work, and engage in trade. Markets, residential areas, and commercial districts interweave to create a vibrant and thriving urban tapestry.

The outer rings are constantly evolving, as the magical outer walls of Sen expand to accommodate the growing population and new arrivals from different worlds. This fluidity allows the city to adapt and integrate new cultures and innovations seamlessly. The diverse neighborhoods, each with their unique charm and specialties, contribute to the rich cultural mosaic that defines Sen.

## Beyond the Wall
If you were able to peer over the towering walls of Sen, you would see the sky extend below the horizon. The makeup of Sen's construction confounds scientists and mages to this day, many still seeking to discover the ancient and formidable magic enchanting it's colossal walls. The popular belief is that Sen is a city somehow floating amidst the cosmos, with its own planetary pull.

## Trivia
- Sen has an intricate waterway and aqueduct system, providing water and sanitation throughout the city. The water flows from the inner rings of the city through large, elevated stone channels that carry it to every street in Sen. It flows from an infinite source of clean and fresh drinking water. Like many of Sen's features, the availability of water fluctuates to accomodate the city's needs. Oftentimes during sunrise, a prismatic spray of mist fills the air as water cascades down from the aqueducts, creating a warm misty glow in the inner rings.
- It is said that Sira's gift to Sen was the blue sky, to mask the darkness of the cosmos during the day and to provide the people of Sen with hope and a bright outlook to their days in the city. 
- Maliph is the smallest and darkest of the moons of Sen. It is often associated with Sadh; The Twisted Dark uses it as a spyglass into Sen's inner workings. It was omitted from the calendar for this purpose, to avoid his malevolent gaze.
