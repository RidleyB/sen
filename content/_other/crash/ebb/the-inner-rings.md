## Estates and Manors

At the border between the inner and outer rings lie the estates and manors of Sen’s ruling families. These residences are more than homes — they are living symbols of prestige, designed to impress guests and remind constituents of their owners’ status. Typical estates feature sprawling gardens, ornate walls and gates, private halls for entertaining, and the kind of architectural grandeur that ensures no visitor forgets who holds power in the city.

While most estates share this sense of refinement, several stand out for their unique character:

- The Santini Estate is among the grandest, with vast gardens, a sweeping party hall for galas, and a family crypt that reinforces their lineage. Its size and history make it one of the city’s most recognized landmarks.
- Reinhardt Manor is built less like a palace and more like a fortress, with training grounds and barracks reflecting their militaristic values. It emphasizes discipline and defense over opulence.
- The Blanchard Villa highlights natural beauty, renowned for its botanical gardens and galleries. It’s less a fortress or palace and more a cultivated retreat that reflects the family’s artistic leanings.
- The Del Vecchio Estate tells a humbler story — once lavish, much of its former glory was stripped away under Ettore Del Vecchio’s scandals. It remains stately, but now its vineyard and restrained charm speak to the family’s resilience and reform.

Beyond these, the city holds countless other estates, each displaying its own quirks — music halls, rare libraries, private menageries — all testaments to the wealth, ambition, and taste (or lack thereof) of Sen’s aristocracy.
