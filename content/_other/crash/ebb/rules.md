## House Rules

### Hidden Death Saves
The DM rolls death saving throws for unconscious characters, only informing of the result upon death, or revival.

### Better Health Potions
You may spend a bonus action to drink a potion to gain it's regular effects. You may also use a standard action to drink a potion. If you do so this way, you instead heal the max amount of hit points the health potion provides.

### Sides Initiative
Players initiatives will be averaged and contested against enemies' initiative average. If the players win, they act first, all together rather than individual turns. On the enemies' turn, they do the same.

### Push the Roll
When you fail a skill check, you may choose to attempt the skill check again, by "pushing" the roll. If you fail on the second attempt, something bad will happen, at the DM's discretion. You may only push a roll once per day, regardless of outcome.
