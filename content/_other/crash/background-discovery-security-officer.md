*You're not here to take in the sights — you're here to make sure everyone else lives long enough to do so. You stand at the edge of every campfire, eyes outward, weapon ready. The Guild's greatest minds don’t mean much if something tears them apart before they can write it down. You're trained, prepared, and when the mission goes loud — you're first in and last out.*

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation
**Tool Proficiencies:** Smith’s tools or Tinker’s tools
**Equipment:** A worn Guild uniform reinforced with light armor plating, a set of manacles, a signal whistle, a whetstone, and a pouch containing 10 gp

### Feature: Defender’s Resolve

As a Guild Security Officer, you've been trained to act decisively under pressure and protect your team at all costs. Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Guardian Instinct:** When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack, you can impose disadvantage on the attack roll as a reaction. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
- **Threat Assessment:** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect hostile creatures or signs of danger (such as blood, disturbed terrain, or broken equipment). Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to determine the cause of injury or damage to structures, bodies, or equipment.
- **Linebreaker:** You're trained in shock-and-awe tactics. You may attempt to shove or grapple as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum once).
