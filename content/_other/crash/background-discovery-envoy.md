*You’re not the strongest or the fastest — but in unfamiliar territory, you are equally as important. You are the voice between worlds, the steady hand during first contact. Whether through language, empathy, or subtle intuition, your job is to keep the mission from becoming a massacre. Some see you as a translator. The wise know you're a shield made of words.*

**Skill Proficiencies:** Persuasion, Insight<br>
**Languages:** Two of your choice<br>
**Equipment:**  A set of traveler’s clothes, a fine quill or musical instrument used for communication, a small token or gift from a previous contact, a scroll case containing sample cultural notes, and a pouch containing 10 gp


### Feature: Diplomatic Specialty

As a Guild Envoy, your training emphasized a particular approach to cross-cultural contact. Choose one of the following specialties:

* **Emissary:** You exude calm, reason, and non-threatening authority. Intelligent hostile creatures may hesitate before attacking if you have not taken aggressive action. The DM may call for a Charisma (Persuasion) check to allow you to delay combat or parley briefly, even with initially hostile parties. Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when attempting to calm frightened or confused creatures with an intelligence of 4 or higher.
* **Psionic Sensitivity** Your mind is unusually attuned to unspoken thought and emotion. As an action, you can sense the surface emotional state (fear, curiosity, hostility, etc.) of intelligent creatures within 30 feet, even if they are nonverbal or alien in form. A creature subject to this ability can make a DC 13 Insight check to become aware you are reading them. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
* **Cultural Archivist:** You carry a vast mental library of stories, rituals, taboos, and behavioral models. When encountering a new culture, you may ask the DM one question about that culture’s belief system, social structure, or values (DM discretion applies).

Additionally, you may choose one Intelligence-based skill (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion). You gain proficiency in that skill, or expertise if you are already proficient.
