### Feature: Mantle of Command

You’ve been trained to lead under extreme pressure. Choose two of the following benefits:

- **Crisis Leadership:** When an ally within 30 feet fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to shout a command or warning. They may reroll and must take the new result. You can use this feature once per long rest.
- **Tactical Coordination:** You may use the Help action as a bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
- **Resolve of the Leader:** When an ally is frightened, charmed, or stunned, you may spend your reaction to grant them an immediate saving throw against the effect (no advantage). You may do this once per long rest.
- **Strategic Mapping:** You can recall battlefield layouts and enemy positions with great clarity. When in an environment you've studied (or observed for at least 10 minutes), you have advantage on Intelligence checks to navigate, predict movement, or avoid ambushes.
