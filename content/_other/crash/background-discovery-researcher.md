title: "Guild Researcher"
type: "background"
---

*You are the mind behind the mission — the one trusted to observe, record, and analyze the incomprehensible. While others wield blades or bark orders, you parse reality itself, chasing understanding in the chaos of the unknown.*

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Insight
**Tool Proficiencies:** Alchemist’s supplies or Calligrapher’s supplies
**Equipment:** A Guild researcher’s robe, a set of alchemist’s or calligrapher’s tools (your choice), a journal bound in waterproof hide, a set of ink and pens, and a pouch containing 10 gp

### Feature: Academic Fieldwork

You are trained to extract insight under pressure. Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Field Theorist:** When you take the Help action to assist an ally with a skill check involving Intelligence, Wisdom, or Constitution, they gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus in addition to advantage.
- **Empirical Calm:** When you or an ally within 10 feet fails a Wisdom saving throw against fear or confusion, you can use your reaction to provide grounding logic or soothing rationale. That creature may immediately reroll the saving throw. You can use this this feature once per long rest.
- **Field Work:** Learn one cantrip from the Wizard spell table. Additionally, once per day you can use a ritual casting time of 1 minute instead of 10 minutes for any spell you cast as a ritual. 

### Suggested Characteristics

**Personality Traits:**
1. I speak in precise, overly technical language even in casual situations.
2. I document everything, often during wildly inappropriate moments.
3. I have a childlike fascination with things I don’t understand.
4. I’m far more comfortable around strange phenomena than I am around people.

**Ideals:**
1. **Understanding:** Every mystery has a solution if we ask the right questions. (Neutral)
2. **Preservation:** Knowledge lost is a wound to the future. (Good)
3. **Logic:** Emotion clouds clarity. The truth lies in data and observation. (Lawful)
4. **Curiosity:** I want to witness things no one else has. I want to *know.* (Chaotic)

**Bonds:**
1. My research mentor vanished on a mission like this — I will finish their work.
2. My field journals are sacred. I’d rather lose a limb than a volume.
3. The Guild is my family. Without it, I’d be a footnote in a forgotten archive.
4. I once touched something I shouldn’t have. It’s still… changing me.

**Flaws:**
1. I value knowledge more than safety — even my own.
2. I struggle to act without concrete data, even in urgent moments.
3. I secretly fear that understanding Plibt might cost me my sanity.
4. I believe I'm the smartest one in any room — and I act like it.
