# Setting

At the heart of the known universe lies Sen, a city built at the center of a convergence of arcane gateways, connecting countless worlds together. A sprawling metropolis that stands as a testament to diversity and cultural unity. Its streets wind through districts teeming with life, its towering spires piercing the sky, and its bustling markets offering goods from every culture. From the opulent halls of its noble houses to the crooked alleys of its more crowded boroughs, Sen pulses with the vibrant energy of progress and innovation.

Renowned as an epicenter of culture, technology, and politics, Sen is a beacon of civilization in an ever-changing world. Its grand theaters host great performances, its universities attract the brightest scholars and mages, and its bustling markets offer the latest marvels of modern invention. Here, ideas are born, alliances are forged, and the course of history is shaped by the actions of its inhabitants.

At the pinnacle of Sen's society stands its aristocracy, a collection of powerful families whose influence spans a large portion of the city. The city is too large to be governed by one centralized government, and so the city has broken up its governance throughout large connections of boroughs, each controlled and governed by elected bodies by the people in those boroughs. These noble houses oversee vast boroughs of the city, each wielding considerable power and authority in Sen's complex political landscape. Alliances are fragile, and rivalries run deep

Our story surrounds the prestigious Santini family, and the other political families operating in their section of the city. Together, they all hold a significant share of influence all vying for power in their boroughs and looking to expand further. Recently, a growing destabilizing threat has emerged, threatening violence, cultist activity, and terror throughout the streets. The families can no longer ignore this presence, and a grand gala event has been called to formally address the growing threat of this dark player, "The Violet Lady".

The [Reinhardts]({% post_url 2024-01-01-name %}, the [Del Vecchios]({% post_url 2024-01-01-name %}, the [Blanchards]({% post_url 2024-01-01-name %}, and the [Montaignes]({% post_url 2024-01-01-name %} will all be in attendance at the grand gala, spreading their influence and socializing with the city's elite. Each family has their own involvement with the Santinis and their own agendas they're trying to push. 

# Threat

In addition to navigating the complexities of their internal dynamics, the Santini family must also contend with external threats that lurk in the shadows. Chief among these is the enigmatic [Violet Lady]({% post_url 2024-01-01-name %}, a shadowy figure whose motives and origins remain shrouded in mystery. Recent events have seen a surge in attacks throughout the city, with warehouses containing valuable magical materials being targeted with alarming frequency. Reports have also surfaced of necromantic disturbances affecting the interests of not only the Santini family but also their allies in the Blanchard and Del Vecchio clans. Furthermore, whispers of cultist activity have spread like wildfire, though no arrests have been made, leaving the city's residents to speculate on the true nature of these dark forces at work.

Despite the escalating threat posed by the Violet Lady and her nefarious activities, the response from the great families of Sen has been notably muted. While rumors and whispers of the Violet Lady's actions circulate throughout the city, the great families have thus far been slow to act; this lackluster response has left many residents of Sen feeling vulnerable and exposed, as they look to the Santini family and their allies for leadership and guidance in these troubled times.

# Tips

* Whether you prefer to immerse yourself in the high society intrigue of Sen or pursue other motivations for attending the event, remember that all paths are open to exploration. You don't have to play a character involved in high society, you could be working with the security attach√©, or you could be at the gala hoping to steal from unwitting guests. My ultimate hope is that you make a character that is willing to engage and work with others! 
* While this is a story of political intrigue, be prepared for combat as much as social encounters. Dangers abound! Just as I hope your barbarian can charm the pants off of a politician, I hope your socialite can take a fireball or two. ;)
* Sen is a city of surprises, where nothing is as it seems. Be prepared for twists and turns at every corner, as allies become enemies and enemies become allies. Keep your wits about you and trust no one, for in this world, deception is common currency.
