### **Setting**

At the heart of the known universe lies Sen, a city built at the center
of a convergence of arcane gateways, connecting countless worlds
together. A sprawling metropolis that stands as a testament to diversity
and cultural unity. Its streets wind through districts teeming with
life, its towering spires piercing the sky, and its bustling markets
offering goods from every culture. From the opulent halls of its noble
houses to the crooked alleys of its more crowded boroughs, Sen pulses
with the vibrant energy of progress and innovation.

Renowned as an epicenter of culture, technology, and politics, Sen is a
beacon of civilization in an ever-changing world. Its grand theaters
host great performances, its universities attract the brightest scholars
and mages, and its bustling markets offer the latest marvels of modern
invention. Here, ideas are born, alliances are forged, and the course of
history is shaped by the actions of its inhabitants.

At the pinnacle of Sen's society stands its aristocracy, a collection of
powerful families whose influence spans a large portion of the city. The
city is too large to be governed by one centralized government, and so
the city has broken up its governance throughout large connections of
boroughs, each controlled and governed by elected bodies by the people
in those boroughs. These noble houses oversee vast boroughs of the city,
each wielding considerable power and authority in Sen's complex
political landscape. Alliances are fragile, and rivalries run deep

Our story surrounds the prestigious Santini family, and the other
political families operating in their section of the city. Together,
they all hold a significant share of influence all vying for power in
their boroughs and looking to expand further. Recently, a growing
destabilizing threat has emerged, threatening violence, cultist
activity, and terror throughout the streets. The families can no longer
ignore this presence, and a grand gala event has been called to formally
address the growing threat of this dark player, "The Violet Lady".

### **Main Characters**

The \[\[The Santini Family\|**Santini**\]\] family is large and filled
with gifted and skilled individuals, nearly all singular in their
talents. At its head is Viola Santini, matriarch and head of all the
family's operations. In the absence of their late father, Salvatore
Russo, their children have stepped up to each manage their own sections
of the Santini dynasty..

**Viola Santini** \[\[:viola-santini\|(Link)\]\]\
Viola Santini, the revered matriarch of the Santini family, commands
respect and adoration in equal measure. Known for her grace, wisdom, and
unwavering devotion to her family, she is a formidable presence in city
of Sen.

**Salvatore Russo** \[\[:salvatore-russo\|(Link)\]\]\
Salvatore commanded a prominent presence in Sen's aristocracy until his
passing nearly a decade ago. He was a respected figure in Sen's social
circles, known for his contributions to the city's cultural endeavors.

**Francesca Santini** \[\[:francesca-santini\|(Link)\]\]\
The eldest child of Viola Santini. Skilled in both combat and diplomacy,
Francesca is a formidable presence in both the boardroom and the
battlefield. She manages the family's businesses and serves as a lead
enforcer in the Santini boroughs.

**Giovanna Santini** \[\[:giovanna-santini\|(Link)\]\]\
Second eldest child of Viola Santini. Gifted with a sharp mind for
numbers and negotiation, Giovanna oversees the family's finances and
investments, skillfully managing their wealth. Her ambitious nature and
keen business acumen drive her pursuit of wealth and power within Sen's
aristocracy.

**Alessia Santini** \[\[:alessia-santini\|(Link)\]\]\
Third eldest child of Viola Santini. Alessia is the epitome of grace and
charm, often seen at the most exclusive gatherings. While she appears to
live a life of luxury and leisure, Alessia is highly adept at networking
and handling the family's social connections.

**Luciano Santini** \[\[:luciano-santini\|(Link)\]\]\
Fourth eldest child of Viola Santini. The only son of La Madre, Luciano
is often regarded as the black sheep of the family. He is disinterested
and ineffectual when it comes to family affairs, lacking ambition and
the necessary skills to involve himself in the family's enterprises.

**Caterina Santini** \[\[:caterina-santini\|(Link)\]\]\
Fifth eldest child of Viola Santini. The youngest daughter of the
Santini family, Caterina is known for her ability to handle herself in
delicate situations with finesse and grace. She is new to the political
scene, emerging with her newlywed husband Fabrizio de Luca.

Among the Santinis are a number of neighboring families, all players in
the political scene, vying for power amongst the boroughs of Sen. Each
family will play a role in the story, some large and some small. The
\[\[The Reinhardt Family\|**Reinhardts**\]\], the \[\[The Del Vecchio
Family\|**Del Vecchios**\]\], the \[\[The Blanchard
Family\|**Blanchards**\]\], and the \[\[The Montaigne
Family\|**Montaignes**\]\] will all be in attendance at the grand gala,
spreading their influence and socializing with the city's elite. Each
family has their own involvement with the Santinis and their own agendas
they're trying to push.

### **Threat**

In addition to navigating the complexities of their internal dynamics,
the Santini family must also contend with external threats that lurk in
the shadows. Chief among these is the enigmatic
\[\[:the-violet-lady\|**Violet Lady**\]\], a shadowy figure whose
motives and origins remain shrouded in mystery. Recent events have seen
a surge in attacks throughout the city, with warehouses containing
valuable magical materials being targeted with alarming frequency.
Reports have also surfaced of necromantic disturbances affecting the
interests of not only the Santini family but also their allies in the
Blanchard and Del Vecchio clans. Furthermore, whispers of cultist
activity have spread like wildfire, though no arrests have been made,
leaving the city's residents to speculate on the true nature of these
dark forces at work.

Despite the escalating threat posed by the Violet Lady and her nefarious
activities, the response from the great families of Sen has been notably
muted. While rumors and whispers of the Violet Lady's actions circulate
throughout the city, the great families have thus far been slow to act;
this lackluster response has left many residents of Sen feeling
vulnerable and exposed, as they look to the Santini family and their
allies for leadership and guidance in these troubled times.

### **Tips**

-   Whether you prefer to immerse yourself in the high society intrigue
    of Sen or pursue other motivations for attending the event, remember
    that all paths are open to exploration. You don't have to play a
    character involved in high society, you could be working with the
    security attach√©, or you could be at the gala hoping to steal from
    unwitting guests. My ultimate hope is that you make a character that
    is willing to engage and work with others!
-   While this is a story of political intrigue, be prepared for combat
    as much as social encounters. Dangers abound! Just as I hope your
    barbarian can charm the pants off of a politician, I hope your
    socialite can take a fireball or two. ;)
-   Sen is a city of surprises, where nothing is as it seems. Be
    prepared for twists and turns at every corner, as allies become
    enemies and enemies become allies. Keep your wits about you and
    trust no one, for in this world, deception is common currency.
